Vehicle Service History Analysis: 2020 Jaguar F-Type

Executive Summary

This document synthesizes the service history of a 2020 Jaguar F-Type, VIN SAJDD1GX4LCK67497, based on a comprehensive review of invoices and diagnostic reports from October 2024 to November 2025. The analysis reveals a progression of significant and recurring issues across multiple vehicle systems, beginning with electrical faults, moving to chronic cooling system failures, and culminating in a critical powertrain malfunction.

The vehicle's history shows two primary early issues: a persistent electrical fault in the driver-side door electronics, which required a harness repair, and a chronic failure within the engine's cooling system. The cooling system repeatedly lost coolant, first attributed to a leaking bleed pipe in November 2024. Nine months later, diagnostic codes confirmed a more systemic issue involving a stuck coolant flow control valve and a malfunctioning variable coolant pump.

In late October 2025, the vehicle developed its most severe problem to date: a check engine light accompanied by a significant loss of power ("limp mode"). An independent diagnostic scan revealed a failing catalyst monitor. Subsequent repairs at an independent specialist, Beach Cities Rover, addressed a `P25A9-13 PISTON COOLING JET FAILURE` and replaced worn spark plugs. This service also revealed two new major concerns: worn engine mounts and a leaking radiator, indicating the cooling system problems persist.

Throughout this period, multi-point inspections consistently recommended extensive brake work. After more than a year of declining this service, the rear brakes, worn to 1mm, were finally replaced in November 2025.

  1. Initial Attempt: A technician found rear junction box fuse RF 08 was blown and replaced it, which temporarily restored window and door lock functions.
  2. Recurring Failure & Deep Diagnosis: The problem re-emerged ("A MILLISECOND AFTER RF08 BLEW AGAIN"). A subsequent, more detailed investigation found a "CIRCUIT SHORT CIRCUIT TO GROUND" between the left engine junction box and the rear junction box. The root cause was identified as a shorted connector at the left engine junction box (CIBB01A-16) that was resting on the vehicle's ground. A harness repair was performed, and the issue was resolved.
- Customer Complaint 2: "LOW BATTERY WARNING LIGHT COMES ON THE CLUSTER."
- Technician Findings & Resolution: A diagnostic check revealed fault code U3003-16. Multiple battery tests, both in and out of the vehicle, confirmed the battery had failed. A new battery (Part #T2H33020) was installed, and the battery monitoring system was reset, clearing the warning message. All services were performed at no charge.

November 2024: Initial Cooling System Repair

Diagnostic Trouble Code (DTC) Analysis

Diagnostic scans were performed at two key points, revealing a progression of failures from the cooling system to the core powertrain.

August 2025: Cooling System Faults (West Adams Radiator)

A scan at 28,812 miles revealed numerous fault codes, with the most critical relating to the powertrain and cooling system.

- **Key Powertrain & Cooling System Faults**
  - `P2B61-73`: Engine coolant flow control valve stuck closed.
  - `P26CB-72`: Variable coolant pump performance/stuck off.
  - These codes directly corroborated the customer's complaint of recurring coolant loss and pointed to a systemic failure beyond the previously replaced hose.

- **Other Notable Faults**
  - `B1412-96`: Quiescent relay box - Component internal fault (Permanent).
  - `U3001-46`: Control module improper shutdown (Permanent).
  - Numerous "High speed CAN communication bus" errors and "Invalid serial data received" faults, suggesting potential underlying electrical sensitivities.

October 2025: Powertrain and Emissions Faults (Mode 6 Report & Beach Cities Rover)

Diagnostic data from late October 2025, prior to the major engine repair, confirmed a new set of critical issues.

- **Key Emissions System Faults (Mode 6 Report, Oct 26, 2025)**
  - `Catalyst Monitor Bank 1`: Status **Complete and Fail**. This indicates the catalytic converter is not operating at the required efficiency, directly supporting the technician's note of a "pending cat efficiency code."
  - `VVT Monitor Bank 1`: Status **Complete and Fail**. This points to a problem with the variable valve timing system.

- **Key Powertrain Faults (Beach Cities Rover, Oct 29, 2025)**
  - `P25A9-13`: Piston cooling jet failure. This fault indicates a malfunction in the system that sprays oil onto the underside of the pistons to cool them, a critical function for engine longevity and performance.
