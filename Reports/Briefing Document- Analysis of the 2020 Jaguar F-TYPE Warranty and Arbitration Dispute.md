Briefing Document: Analysis of the 2020 Jaguar F-TYPE Warranty and Arbitration Dispute

Executive Summary

This document synthesizes a series of events concerning a used 2020 Jaguar F-TYPE (VIN: SAJDD1GX4LCK67497) purchased by consumer Nyree Hinton. The core of the dispute centers on the vehicle's significant, recurring mechanical and electrical defects, the manufacturer's refusal to repurchase the vehicle, and the subsequent failure of a state-certified arbitration program to adjudicate the claim under all applicable laws.

After purchasing the vehicle with an active transferable manufacturer's warranty, the consumer experienced numerous faults, including critical electrical short circuits and coolant system failures, which are corroborated by multiple technical bulletins issued by Jaguar for this model. Jaguar Land Rover North America, LLC (JLRNA) denied a repurchase request under California's Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act.

Crucially, JLRNA's denial letter mandated that the consumer use the BBB AUTO LINE arbitration program before pursuing court remedies under both the state Song-Beverly Act and the federal Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act (MMWA). However, the BBB AUTO LINE arbitrator dismissed the case, citing the recent California Supreme Court ruling in Rodriguez v. FCA US, LLC, which established that a used vehicle with a remaining warranty does not qualify as a "new motor vehicle" for the purposes of the Song-Beverly Act's buyback remedy. The arbitrator explicitly refused to consider remedies under the MMWA, stating it was "not within the purview" of the program. This created a direct conflict with JLRNA's referral and the program's own stated rules, leaving the consumer without the mandated arbitration for their federal warranty claims.

Subsequent actions included complaints filed with the California Bureau of Automotive Repair, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) regarding safety defects, and the California Arbitration Certification Program challenging the BBB's refusal to exercise its full jurisdiction. Post-warranty diagnostics confirm the persistence of widespread systemic faults within the vehicle.

II. Legal and Regulatory Framework

The dispute involves the intersection of California's state-specific "lemon law" and broader federal warranty protections, complicated by a recent court decision that reshaped the legal landscape for used vehicles.

A. California Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act ("Lemon Law")

The Song-Beverly Act provides enhanced remedies, including manufacturer repurchase or replacement, for consumers of defective "new motor vehicles." A central legal document in the source context, an "Answer to Petition for Review" in the case Rodriguez et al. v. FCA US, LLC, provides the legal precedent that directly impacted this dispute.

* Core Precedent (Rodriguez v. FCA US, LLC): The California Supreme Court affirmed that the Act's definition of a "new motor vehicle" does not include a used car sold by a third-party dealer, even if it has an unexpired portion of the original manufacturer's warranty. The court concluded that the phrase "other motor vehicle sold with a manufacturer’s new car warranty" refers to vehicles like dealer-owned demonstrators or service loaners sold with a full new car warranty at the time of sale, not a transferred, partial warranty.
* Impact on Case: This ruling was the sole basis upon which BBB AUTO LINE dismissed the consumer's claim for a repurchase remedy from the manufacturer under the Song-Beverly Act.

B. Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act (MMWA)

The MMWA is a federal law governing consumer product warranties. Unlike the Song-Beverly Act, its protections are not limited to "new" goods.

* Applicability: The consumer argued that the MMWA applies because the transferable Jaguar EliteCare is a "written warranty" under the Act. As a subsequent owner who received the vehicle during the warranty's duration, the consumer qualifies for protection. The MMWA provides remedies, including refund or replacement, if a warrantor fails to repair defects within a reasonable time.
* Jurisdictional Conflict: JLRNA explicitly required the consumer to use BBB AUTO LINE arbitration "before exercising rights or seeking remedies created by Title I of the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act." This established a procedural requirement for the arbitration program to hear MMWA claims.

C. State-Certified Arbitration (BBB AUTO LINE)

BBB AUTO LINE is an arbitration program certified by the California Department of Consumer Affairs (DCA) to resolve warranty disputes.

* Mandatory Use: JLRNA's participation in the program and its referral letter made arbitration a mandatory prerequisite for the consumer to pursue certain legal remedies.
* Jurisdictional Failure: The arbitrator's decision on March 24, 2025, created the central conflict of the case by stating: "There may be other bases upon which this claim might be eligible for relief, such as perhaps the federal Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act, however, consideration of those other options is not within the purview of the California Lemon Law nor the Auto Line Program."
* Contradiction with Program Rules: This statement appears to conflict with BBB AUTO LINE's own Program Summary for California, which lists "Federal Trade Commission regulations set out in 16 C.F.R. Part 703" (the implementing regulations for MMWA) as part of the "Applicable Law" the arbitrator will consider.

IV. Vehicle Condition and Technical Findings

The consumer's reported issues are substantiated by manufacturer-issued service bulletins and independent, post-warranty diagnostic reports, indicating systemic and known problems with the vehicle's model and powertrain.

A. Relevant Manufacturer Service Bulletins

Jaguar Land Rover has issued multiple bulletins for the 2018-2020 F-TYPE and other models with the Ingenium I4 2.0L Petrol engine, addressing the specific symptoms reported:

* Coolant System: Technical Bulletin JLRTB02030NAS1 and Service Action H291 address a fault with the variable coolant pump that causes the engine cooling fan to run constantly at high speed. The associated DTCs are P2B61-73 and P26CB-72, both of which were found as "History" codes in the vehicle's August 2025 diagnostic scan.
* Variable Camshaft Timing (VCT) Solenoids: Technical Bulletins JLRTB02023NAS1/2 and Service Action H299 address insufficient wear resistance of the VCT solenoid bush, leading to an illuminated Malfunction Indicator Lamp (MIL) and various performance issues. The October 2025 Mode 6 report showed a "Complete and Fail" status for the VVT Monitor Bank 1 test.
* Electrical/Battery Issues: SSM 74570 addresses a known battery drain issue caused by the InControl touch head unit. SSM 74763 addresses a non-functional InControl Remote App due to a Telematics Control Unit (TCU) error.

B. Post-Warranty Diagnostic Reports

Independent diagnostics performed in August and October 2025 revealed extensive and unresolved electronic and mechanical faults.

August 27, 2025 - Autel MaxiSys Elite Scan (Odometer: 28,812 miles)

* Total Faults: A total of 33 DTCs were found across 18 separate control modules.
* Key Faults:
  * Gateway Module 'A' (GWM): A permanent "Component internal fault" (B1412-96) was identified. This is a critical fault, as the GWM is the central communication hub for the vehicle's electronic systems.
  * Powertrain Control Module (PCM): Three "History" codes were present, including the coolant pump faults P2B61-73 (Engine coolant flow control valve stuck closed) and P26CB-72 (Variable coolant pump performance/stuck off).
  * Widespread Communication Errors: Numerous modules reported communication bus errors (e.g., U0001-81, U0046-81), consistent with a failing GWM.
  * Passenger Front Seat Module (PSM): A permanent "Control module improper shutdown (voltage related)" fault (U3001-46) suggests a past low-voltage event, corroborating reports of battery issues.

October 18, 2025 - Mode 6 Report

* VVT Monitor Failure: The report showed a "Complete and Fail" status for the VVT Monitor Bank 1 test (MID: 35, TID: 80), with a value of -58.95° falling outside the acceptable maximum of -58.89°. This aligns with the known VCT solenoid issues detailed in Service Action H299.
