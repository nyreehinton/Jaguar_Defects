Vehicle Service History Analysis: 2020 Jaguar F-Type

Executive Summary

This document synthesizes the service history of a 2020 Jaguar F-Type, VIN SAJDD1GX4LCK67497, based on a comprehensive review of invoices and diagnostic reports from October 2024 to August 2025. The analysis reveals two primary recurring issues: a persistent electrical fault in the driver-side door electronics and a chronic failure within the engine's cooling system.

The electrical issue first manifested as a non-operational driver-side window, initially diagnosed as a blown fuse. The problem quickly recurred, leading to a more in-depth investigation at Jaguar Land Rover Los Angeles that uncovered a short circuit to ground, requiring a harness repair. Concurrently, the vehicle's battery failed testing and was replaced.

More significantly, the vehicle experienced repeated cooling system failures. In November 2024, a leaking expansion tank bleed pipe was replaced at Jaguar Land Rover Los Angeles. Nine months later, in August 2025, the low coolant warning reappeared. A subsequent diagnostic scan at an independent specialist, West Adams Radiator, identified critical fault codes pointing to a stuck engine coolant flow control valve and a malfunctioning variable coolant pump. The final repair was performed at this independent shop, replacing the supercharger and expansion tank components with customer-supplied parts. These diagnostic codes suggest a more fundamental cause for the coolant loss than the previously replaced pipe.

Throughout this period, multi-point inspections consistently recommended extensive brake work, with rear brake pads measuring near minimum thickness, though these services were repeatedly declined.

Comprehensive Service Chronology

October 2024: Electrical Faults and Battery Replacement

The vehicle experienced significant electrical issues centered on the driver-side door electronics and battery, requiring service at two separate Jaguar Land Rover facilities.

Service Visit 1: Jaguar Land Rover South Bay (Invoice #908960)

- Date of Service: October 2, 2024
- Mileage: 23,072
- Customer Complaint: Driver-side window does not roll up.
- Technician Findings: The service technician verified the window switch was non-operational. Investigation revealed a blown fuse at the rear junction box for the front left door module. A check for ground from the junction box to the door module indicated a short to ground.
- Resolution: The fuse was replaced, which restored power to the left front door module and window functionality. The service was performed at no charge.

Service Visit 2: Jaguar Land Rover Los Angeles (Invoice #824373)

- Date of Service: October 7-14, 2024
- Mileage: 23,278
- Customer Complaint 1: Driver-side door electronics do not operate.
- Technician Findings & Resolution:
  1. Initial Attempt: A technician found rear junction box fuse RF 08 was blown and replaced it, which temporarily restored window and door lock functions.
  2. Recurring Failure & Deep Diagnosis: The problem re-emerged ("A MILLISECOND AFTER RF08 BLEW AGAIN"). A subsequent, more detailed investigation found a "CIRCUIT SHORT CIRCUIT TO GROUND" between the left engine junction box and the rear junction box. The root cause was identified as a shorted connector at the left engine junction box (CIBB01A-16) that was resting on the vehicle's ground. A harness repair was performed, and the issue was resolved.
- Customer Complaint 2: "LOW BATTERY WARNING LIGHT COMES ON THE CLUSTER."
- Technician Findings & Resolution: A diagnostic check revealed fault code U3003-16. Multiple battery tests, both in and out of the vehicle, confirmed the battery had failed. A new battery (Part #T2H33020) was installed, and the battery monitoring system was reset, clearing the warning message. All services were performed at no charge.

November 2024: Initial Cooling System Repair

- Service Provider: Jaguar Land Rover Los Angeles
- Date of Service: November 18-21, 2024 (based on work order #825556 and invoice #825649)
- Mileage: 23,963
- Customer Complaint: "A COOLING SYSTEM CLIENT STATES LOW COOLANT WARNING LIGHT IS ON." The invoice notes the vehicle's warranty expired on November 8, 2024, and an appointment could not be secured until after this date.
- Technician Findings: A pressure test of the cooling system confirmed that the "BLEED PIPE FROM EXPANSION TANK LEAKING COOLANT."
- Resolution: The leaking expansion tank bleed pipe was removed and replaced with a new hose (Part #T2R47919). The system was then vacuum-filled with new antifreeze (Part #T2H59152), and a test drive confirmed no further leaks.
- Cost: The total cost for this repair was $294.62, paid via American Express.

August 2025: Recurring Cooling System Failure & Independent Repair

Nine months after the initial repair, the cooling system issue returned, prompting a visit to the dealer followed by diagnosis and repair at an independent shop.

- Service Provider: Jaguar Land Rover Los Angeles (Work Order #100821)
- Date of Service: August 20, 2025
- Mileage: 28,769
- Customer Complaint: "CUSTOMER STATES LOW COOLANT WARNING COMING ON." A brake pad warning was also noted.
- Outcome: A preliminary estimate of $325.88 was provided. The vehicle was subsequently taken to West Adams Radiator for further diagnosis and repair.

---

- Service Provider: West Adams Radiator
- Date of Service: August 25-26, 2025
- Mileage: 28,812
- Technician Findings: A diagnostic scan was performed on August 27, 2025. The scan revealed critical fault codes stored in the Powertrain Control Module directly related to the cooling system failure (see Section 3 for details).
- Resolution:
  1. Parts Procurement: The customer purchased parts directly from Jaguar Land Rover Los Angeles on August 26, 2025, for a total of $445.68. This included a new expansion tank hose (Part #T2R47919), the same part replaced in November 2024.
  2. Warranty Refund: On August 29, 2025, the hose (Part #T2R47919) was returned to Jaguar Land Rover Los Angeles for a full refund of $121.57, cited as a "WARRANTY SWAP REFUND."

Diagnostic Trouble Code (DTC) Analysis

A comprehensive vehicle diagnostic report was generated by West Adams Radiator on August 27, 2025, at 28,812 miles. The scan of 33 vehicle systems revealed numerous fault codes, with the most critical relating to the powertrain and cooling system.

Key Powertrain & Cooling System Faults

These codes, found in the Powertrain Control Module (PCM), directly corroborate the customer's complaint of recurring coolant loss and point to a systemic failure beyond the previously replaced hose.

DTC Code Description Status Implication
P2B61-73 Engine coolant flow control valve stuck closed - Actuator stuck closed History Indicates a malfunction where the valve controlling coolant flow could not operate, leading to overheating or improper cooling.
P26CB-72 Variable coolant pump performance/stuck off - Actuator stuck open History Signals a failure or performance issue with the main coolant pump, preventing proper circulation of coolant through the engine.

Other Notable Faults

The diagnostic scan also identified a wide array of historical and permanent faults across other systems, suggesting potential underlying electrical sensitivities.

System Module Fault Summary
Body Control Module (BCM) 5 DTCs, including turn signal circuits "stuck low" and steering column circuit shorts.
Gateway Module 'A' (GWM) B1412-96: Quiescent relay box - Component internal fault (Permanent status).
Passenger Front Seat Module (PSM) U3001-46: Control module improper shutdown (Permanent status).
Various Modules Numerous "High speed CAN communication bus" errors and "Invalid serial data received" faults.
