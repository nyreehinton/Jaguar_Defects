DESCRIPTION
 
This document informs dealers and customers of a known issue on non-towing MVs equipped with feature 04GBL  BRAKE,
PARKING {Bendix Intellipark} Electronic Park Brake, for Truck or Bus Applications. If the operator of the vehicle attempts to
release the parking brake with any door open it will not release. Currently , other Intellipark feature codes and other models of
vehicles will display a warning in the instrument cluster screen that the parking brake will not release due to the door being open
(Figure 1).  On MVs with 04GBL, this message currently does not display .  If the operator of the vehicle complains that the
parking brake will not release verify all doors are closed, the service brake is applied, and the ignition key is on.  A future
software release will add this functionality to MVs with 04GBL.
