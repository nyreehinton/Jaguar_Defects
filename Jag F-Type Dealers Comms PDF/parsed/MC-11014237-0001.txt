Frt Stabilizer assembly
BSR from the front end due to Smartbar (disconnecting front sway bar). Root cause was
identified as anti-rotation bracket (connects the actuator to the stabar) coming loose due to
inadequate clamp load at the joint and weld (holds the bolt shaft and bracket flange) was
poorly designed. If any vehicle causes BSR because of this Bracket failure (loose joint/
bracket bends) DO NOT  replace whole stabar assembly , instead replace with the service kit
(PN#68730602AA). Dealer must need to order the parts from part ordering system for this
claim. This kit contains 1 bracket (PN 68730603AA), 3 M10 Nut (PN 68730605AA), 2
M8X1.5 Bolt (PN 68730606AA) and 2 M10X1.5 bolt (PN 06513427AA). 1 M10 Bolt (PN
68730607AA). This kit will also contain a new torque instruction for the bolt which holds the
clamp bracket to this failed anti-rotation bracket. DO NOT  apply the old torque (45+/5Nm
Direct torque). The new torque is Angle controlled torque monitor (20Nm Snug torque, 1 10
deg Angle, monitor torque within 40-70Nm). Please use Service Library for your reference.
