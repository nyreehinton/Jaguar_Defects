Introduction  
A battery in a stored vehicle is subject to conditions that can reduce its performance and service 
life. These conditions include storage period, temperature, parasitic drain, and battery load. 
Because of these factors, battery inspection and maintenance a re required in order to ensure 
proper operation and optimal battery life.   
 
Refer to the table below for a definition of terms used in this bulletin.  
Table 1.  
TERM  ACRONYM  DEFINITION  
Conventional  Vehicle  CV A vehicle with  only a gasoline  engine  for propulsion  
Electrified  Vehicle  EV A vehicle that utilizes a hybrid, plug -in hybrid, or battery 
electric system for propulsion  
Hybrid  Electric  Vehicle  HEV A vehicle with both a gasoline engine and a HV Battery  
Plug-in Hybrid  Electric  Vehicle  PHEV  A vehicle with both a gasoline engine and a HV Battery that 
can be charged externally  
Battery Electric Vehicle  BEV A vehicle with only a HV Battery that can be  
charged externally  
State  of Charge  SOC  The remaining capacity available in a battery  
12-Volt 12V Standard  12V battery  used  to power  electrical  systems  
separate  from high voltage  components  
High Voltage  HV HV Battery  used  to power  the electrified  vehicle  
 
Electrified vehicles are equipped with two types of batteries, a  HV battery and a 12V battery. 
Conventional vehicles are equipped with only a 12 V battery.  
 
As a matter of policy, Lexus does not provide battery warranty coverage for discharged and/or 
failed batteries due to lack of maintenance. It is the dealer’s responsibility to maintain t he specified 
SOC of the vehicle’s battery while in stock and ensure proper SOC at delivery.  
 
To reduce customer service concerns due to an undercharged battery, ALL dealers should test 
the 12V battery and recharge, if necessary, no more than 48 hours befor e delivery to  
the customer.  
 
 
  CAUTION  
Refer to the precautions listed in the DSS-5000 Instruction Manual  and DCA -8000 Instruction 
Manual  located at  TIS – Diagnostics – Tools & Equipment – Battery Diagnostics .

Battery Inspection Procedure  
Test the 12V battery using the DSS -5000 Battery Diagnostic Tool’s PDI mode or the DCA -8000 
Battery Diagnostic Tool’s PDS/PDI  mode. ALWAYS perform the battery test directly on the battery 
terminals, avoid testing the 12V  battery using alternate charging posts or grounds.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Battery Inspection Results  
The PDS/PDI mode was developed to confirm the battery's State of Charge (SOC) to ensure  
the proper operation and optimal battery life. The DSS -5000 will check the battery's SOC and 
recommend charging when necessary. The DCA -8000 will check the battery's SOC and  
automatically charge the battery. Once the PDS/PDI mode completes, proceed with o ne of the 
procedures below according to the battery condition results.   
 
DSS-5000 Results  
1. “PDI Complete ” – Return the battery to service.  
2. “PDI Incomplete ” – Fully charge the battery using the DCA -8000 in PDS/PDI mode.  
3. “PDI Fail” – detected a battery concer n, test the battery using the DCA -8000  in 
Advanced Battery Test  mode.  
 
DCA -8000 Results  
1. “PDS/PDI Complete ” – Return the battery to service . 
2. If the PDS/PDI mode detects a battery concern, test the battery using the DCA -8000 in 
Advanced Battery Test  mode.  
 
  NOTE  
 ALL vehicles MUST be inspected and charged no more than 48 hours BEFORE delivery to  
the customer.  
 Ensure ALL doors stay closed and lights remain OFF during battery testing and charging . 
 For details on how to use the battery diagnostic station, refer to the DSS-5000 Instruction Manual   
and DCA -8000 Instruction Manual  located at TIS – Diagnostics – Tools & Equipment –  
Battery Diagnostics . 
 
NOTICE  
In vehicles equipped with both a 12V battery and a hybrid  battery, the DSS -5000 and  
DCA -8000 Battery Diagnostic Tool is ONLY to be used on the 12V battery.

Battery Replacement Procedure  
If a ve hicle battery ne eds to be replaced for a 
warrantable condition, complete a Warranty 
Battery Label and affix it to the failed battery for 
proper warranty parts and claim processing. 
Include the Vehicle Identification Number 
(VIN) and warranty code on the Warranty  
Battery Label.  
  Figure 1. 
 
 
 
 
Periodic  Battery Maintenance  
In addition to this pre -delivery battery test, periodic battery maintenance  is still  required for stored 
vehicles. If your dealership is in an area subject to extreme  temperatures (hot or cold), periodic 
maintenance may need to be performed  more frequently.  
 
If the vehicle is stored for over 30 days, be sure to follow Long -Term Vehicle Storage Guidelines . 
 
To reduce parasitic battery drain on vehicles  that are placed  in storage for one week or more, the 
negative ( –) battery cable should ALWAYS be disconnected to reduce battery discharge.  
When the negative  (–) battery cable is reconnected, check and reset electrical  components, such 
as the clock, radio, etc., and  re-initialize ALL applicable  systems/functions.  
 
Refer to the appropriate model and year Repair M anual for torque specifications : 
Repair Manual – General – Maintenance – Battery – Installation .

Maintenance for HV Battery during PDS (HEV and PHEV  models)  
The SOC of the HV battery may have gradually decreased during the time the vehicle was being 
transported to your dealership. To prevent the HV battery from deteriorating, perform the following 
maintenance service at the time of PDS.  
Charging the  HV battery  
1. Park the vehicle in open air or connect the 
exhaust extraction hose to the exhaust pipe.  
2. Apply the parking brake.  
3. With the brake pedal depressed, select the 
power switch to the “START” mode, and 
check that the “READY” light in the 
combination meter illuminates when the 
hybrid system starts (the “READY” light  
is ON).  
4. Turn OFF ALL lights and accessories.  
5. Check that the shift lever is in the  
“P” position.  
6. Keep the “READY” light ON and charge the 
HV battery for 30 minutes.   Figure 2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  NOTE  
 If the amount  of charging energy is small,  the display may NOT indicate  the energy flow. 
 Ensure  there  is a sufficient  amount  of fuel in the vehicle to run for at least 30 minutes.  
HINT  
The HV battery can also be charged by driving the vehicle for 30 minutes.

Maintenance for HV Battery during PDS (BEV models)   
 
BEV models store electricity received via an external power source in the HV battery. The SOC of 
the HV battery may have gradually decreased during the time the vehicle was being transported 
to your dealership reducing vehicle range. To prevent the HV batt ery from fully discharging, 
perform the following procedure at the time of PDS to maintain the charge level of the HV battery.  
 
 
1. If the warning light is displayed ON within the combination meter, charge the HV battery via the 
AC charging method.

2. After charging has been completed, verify the HV battery warning light is OFF before storing 
the vehicle long -term. If the HV battery warning light is still ON after charging, repeat the 
charging process.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 NOTE  
 Model -specific information for charging the HV battery, charging equipment, and charging method  
can be referenced from the vehicle’s owner’s manual. Avoid using the DC charger for supplementary 
charging during PDS.  
 For additional vehicle care points, reference the model specific PDS bulletin and  PDS check sheet.  
 Refer to Long Term Storage Guidelines  when the vehicle is to be store d for more than 30 days at the 
dealership.
