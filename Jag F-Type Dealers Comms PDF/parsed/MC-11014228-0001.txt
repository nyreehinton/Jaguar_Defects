Reports are being received of both DTCMs and Transfer Case assemblies being 
replaced for these DTCs. When tested, these components are coming back a Trouble 
Not Found (TNF). If you receive a vehicle in with the above condition, please be sure 
to follow all normal published diagnostics for the DTCs. If after all wiring harnesses and 
connections to the Front Axle Disconnect (FAD) have been verified, be sure to replace 
the FAD first as the DTCM or Transfer Case will not typically repair these DTCs.
