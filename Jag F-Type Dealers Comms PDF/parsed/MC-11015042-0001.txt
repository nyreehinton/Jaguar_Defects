Condition 1Important: Do not add any lubricant to the inserts or springs. Lubricant can attract dirt
and debris which can lead to noise and premature insert wear. Some lubricants can also
chemically attack the insert material.
Some customers may comment on a squeak type noise heard from the rear of the
vehicle.
Upon further investigation, the technician may diagnose the noise is coming from the rear
suspension leaf spring area.
Condition 2Some customers may comment on a clunking type of noise heard from the rear of the
vehicle.
Upon further investigation, the technician may diagnose the noise is coming from the rear
suspension leaf spring area.
CauseThis condition may be caused by debris getting between the leaf springs and/or loose U-
Bolts.Subject:
Page 2 February, 2025 Bulletin No.: 19-NA-129
Correction 1Note: 2020 vehicles built at Silao after March 17, 2020, or built at Fort Wayne after
June 11, 2020, are possible candidates for torque relaxation at the U-bolt to axle and the
1610 km (1000 miles) break-in period but should NOT  have new inserts installed. The
service inserts are the same as the production inserts.
For earlier built vehicles, install new rear leaf spring inserts, following the Service
Procedure below.
Correction 2Note: Vehicles built after the 2020 breakpoints noted above, may still have torque relaxa-
tion at the U-bolt to axle and should have the re-torque performed.
Re-torque the U-bolts of the leaf spring assembly, following the Service Procedure below.
 
Important: Service agents must comply with all International, Federal, State, Provincial, and/or Local laws
applicable to the activities it performs under this bulletin, including but not limited to handling, deploying,
preparing, classifying, packaging, marking, labeling, and shipping dangerous goods. In the event of a
conflict between the procedures set forth in this bulletin and the laws that apply to your dealership, you
must follow those applicable laws.
 
Service Procedure (Condition 1)
Prior to performing this bulletin, follow the procedure for Noise Diagnosis - Rear Suspension in SI to determine the
source of the noise. Jounce the rear of the vehicle utilizing J 39570  Chassis Ear or equivalent, to aid in locating the
source of the noise.
If necessary, road test the vehicle.
1. Raise the vehicle on a frame lift-type hoist. Refer to Lifting and Jacking the Vehicle,  in SI.
2. Inspect the rear leaf springs and shackles for damage.
• If damage has been found, refer to Rear Spring Shackle Replacement or Leaf Spring Replacement (1500),  in
SI.
• If damage has NOT been found, proceed to the next step.
5341853
3. Install new Rear Leaf Spring Inserts using the following procedure:
3.1. Clean the springs using high-pressure water or a steam cleaner to remove any lubricant or contamination
from between the leaf elements, paying special attention to the tip contact areas.
Bulletin No.: 19-NA-129 February, 2025 Page 3
5341854
Caution: Do NOT damage the finish on Leaf Springs.
3.2. On the spring assembly, insert a plastic trim tool or plastic wedge in between the #1 and #2 leaf springs,
to access the old insert.
5341855
3.3. Push up on insert until it hits the bottom of the spring above it. Then use a suitable cutting tool to cut the
stem off from the insert.
Page 4 February, 2025 Bulletin No.: 19-NA-129
5341856
3.4. Remove the top portion of the insert, and then remove the bottom portion of the remaining stem.
5341857
3.5. Using a rag and degreaser, clean any dirt or grease from between the leaf springs at the insert location.
Bulletin No.: 19-NA-129 February, 2025 Page 5
5341859
Caution: Do NOT damage the surface of the new insert when trimming.
3.6. Cut the stem of the new insert with a hacksaw or suitable cutting tool. Make sure to leave 6 mm (0.240 in)
of the stem.
5341861
3.7. Apply a small amount of RTV sealer around the remaining portion of the stem.
3.8. Install the new insert into the leaf spring. Make sure the stem portion lines up with the slot in the spring.
Remove the plastic trim tool or plastic wedge to close the spring and seat the new insert.
4. Repeat step #3 for the 3 remaining inserts.
Important: After a new vehicle is delivered to a customer, or new spring tip inserts are installed per this bulletin, new
inserts have a break-in period of up to 1610 km (1000 miles), where some noise can be expected. The gray spring
inserts are designed to work with absolutely no lubricant. Lubricants of any kind must never be used on the
gray spring tip inserts and any remaining lubricant must be completely removed when installing new tip
inserts.
5. Lower the vehicle to the ground and test drive to verify the repair.
Page 6 February, 2025 Bulletin No.: 19-NA-129
Note: If the vehicle returns with noise after this procedure, and there is no loss of torque at the U-Bolts, thoroughly
clean the spring contact points with high pressure water or a steam cleaner to remove contaminants from between
the spring elements. Contaminants, grease, undercoating or any substance in the leaf interface will cause noise
when the spring elements move over each other.
Important: If the Spring Tip Inserts have been replaced and 1000 miles (1610 km) has not elapsed, proceed to
Service Procedure (Condition 2).
Service Procedure (Condition 2)
1. Support the vehicle at curb height to relieve the tension on the leaf springs, when re-torquing the leaf spring U-
bolt nuts.
5357922
2. Loosen the anchor plate U-bolts (1).
Caution: Ensure that the proper torque procedure for the U-Bolts is followed in SI. Excessive fastener torque will
extrude, and damage, the spring isolators making the condition worse.
3. Re-torque the anchor plate U-bolts (1). Refer to Fastener Specifications in SI.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for the opposite side leaf spring.
5. Re-test the vehicle for the same clunking noise. If the issue remains, follow the regular repair procedure.
