Supersession Statement
This PI was superseded to update model years. Please discar d PIT4506G.
The following diagnosis might be helpful if the vehicle e xhibits the symptom(s) described
in this PI.
Condition / Concern
Some owners of HD Trucks and Utilities may ask if they can lower their tire pressures from what
is recommended on the "Tire and Loading Label" if the vehicle is not being used for hauling or
towing.
Recommendations / Instructions
The answer is no. Tire pressures being set to the "Tire and Loading Label" will ensure the safe
handling and ride characteristics of the truck. Ride, handling, tire wear, fuel economy, and road
noise concerns may be caused by improperly adjusted tire pressure. 
Note: If the tire pressures are lowered on a vehicle equipped with Tire Pressure Monitor, the
"Check Tire Pressure" message may display on the DIC. The Tire Pressure Monitor system was
implemented to meet FMVSS 139 and cannot be removed or disabled. 
Please follow this diagnostic or r epair pr ocess thor oughly and complete each step. If the
condition e xhibited is r esolved without completing every step, the r emaining steps do not
need to be perfor med.
