Replacement Procedure
1. Replace Mount Screws
Remove both existing mount screws that secure the hood tilt switch
to the bracket. ( Ensure all bracket fasteners are present and
securely tightened. )
Replace them with longer screws to ensure a more secure and
stable connection of the hood tilt switch to the bracket.     
2. Add W ashers
Insert additional washers between the hood tilt switch sensor and the
bracket.
The added washers are essential to prevent any potential signal
interference with the switch magnet, ensuring proper functionality of
the hood tilt switch.
3. Final Check and T esting
Confirm that all components, including the hood tilt switch, mount
screws, and washers, are securely fastened.
Test the hood tilt switch by attempting to initiate the remote start
function with the hood open or tilted. The remote start should not
function when the hood is tilted, as a safety measure.
