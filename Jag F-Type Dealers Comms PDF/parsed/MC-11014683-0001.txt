Title  Software Update for Fuel Plausibility – US/Mexico /Canada  MY24.1 only   
Affected Vehicle(s)  Grenadier  RF005988  - RF017814  
This Technical Service Bulletin (TSB) should only apply to vehicles that demonstrate the described issue 
below.  
 
**This is for MY24.1vehicles only. The TSB only applies to vehicles in the stated 
VIN range.**  
 
Reason for this document  
Issue:  An issue has been identified on a small percentage of the affected vehicle s where the Engine 
Management Light turns on after the vehicle has been re -fuelled . The DTC shown for this is P193208  
Cause:  The a ctual fuel level is not available within the specified time  frame from DME for leakage detection. 
This results in a fuel level un -plausibility after refuelling and puts a n Engine  Management Light  on TTC.  
Action:  Follow the procedure below.  
 
Workshop Procedure  
 
Software Update – US/Mexico/Canada  Vehicles only.  
Operation : SRO  Repair Time : 
Update  XTSBSWUUSA2  0.5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Note:  
- The procedure contains illustrations showing certain components removed to provide 
extra clarity.   
- This procedure contains some variati on in the illustrations depending on the vehicle 
specification, but the essential information is always correct.

Procedure – Updating Head Unit.  
1. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- Flash the Head unit with the latest ‘update’ via USB.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Cautions:  
- Store all Head Unit flash data into a folder called " update " directly in the root of the 
USB stick: (minus Caps sensitive) " Update " WILL NOT WORK  
- Use a known good USB A stick of the following specification  – USB in FAT32 format 
(generic USB format), Minimum of 1 GB Storage capacity, no more than 128G, Free 
from other documents or data on USB stick.  
 
Note:  
- Ensure a dynamic battery charger, capable of outputting 40 Amps is installed to the 
vehicle B+ and earth, do NOT use a trickle charger, the amperage input is not dynamic, 
errors can occur.  
- Do NOT adjust or delete any files in the ‘update’ folder.  
- The latest software version is SW -0000000 773 (HU)  
- If you have an issue while flashing HU, please use a "Branded USB stick".

2. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Before the head unit is flashed. Write down the service interval information.  
o Distance (Miles/Kilometres).  
o Date.  
o Engine running time.  
 
 
3.  
 
 
 
 
 
• Place the vehicle on charge.  
• Ensuring the battery charger can output up to 40 amps to support the vehicle power supply during 
the process.
