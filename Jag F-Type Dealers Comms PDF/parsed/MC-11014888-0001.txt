Module Programming
NOTE: Program appropriate vehicle modules before performing diagnostics and clear all Diagnostic   
            Trouble Codes (DTCs) after programming. For DTCs generated after programming, follow normal 
  diagnostic service procedures. 
1. Connect a battery charger to the 12 Volt (V) battery.
 • Use of a heavy-duty charger is recommended to maintain proper battery voltage during this   
   procedure.
NOTE: Verify the negative cable of the charger is installed on a chassis or engine ground and not 
  the 12V battery negative terminal to prevent the battery saver mode from activating on the 
  vehicle.
NOTE: If the diagnostic software does not load or if the vehicle cannot be identified properly , make sure  
  there is a good internet connection and the Vehicle Communication Module (VCM) is properly 
  connected to the Data Link Connector (DLC). 
2. Log into Ford Diagnostic and Repair System (FDRS).
NOTE: Vehicle information is automatically retrieved by the diagnostic software and a Network Test is   
  run. Vehicle identification data appears on the screen when this is complete. 
3. Click Read VIN from Vehicle or manually enter the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN). 
NOTE: Available modules are shown on the left hand (LH) side of the screen and available procedures   
  are listed on the right hand (RH) side of the screen. Modules that are communicating are 
  highlighted in green. 
4. Select Toolbox  tab.
5. From the list on the LH side of the screen, select the AWD Module .
6. From the list on the RH side of the screen, select AWD - All Wheel Drive Module Software update.
7. Click RUN. Follow all on-screen instructions carefully.

8. From the list on the RH side of the screen, select Self-Test and click RUN.
9. Click the Run Selected Tests button in the lower right.

11. Disconnect the battery charger from the 12V battery once the programming has completed.
Important Information for Module Programming
              
NOTE: When programming a module, use the following basic checks to ensure programming completes   
  without errors.
• Make sure the 12V battery is fully charged before carrying out the programming steps and connect    
  FDRS/scan tool to a power source.
NOTE: A good internet connection is necessary to identify the vehicle and to load the diagnostic software.  
 
• Inspect the Vehicle Communication Module II (VCM II)/Vehicle Communication Module III (VCM III) or      
   the Vehicle Communication and Measurement Module (VCMM) and the cables for any damage. Make            
   sure scan tool connections are not interrupted during   programming.
• A hardwired connection is strongly recommended.
• Turn off all unnecessary accessories (radio, heated/cooled seats, headlamps, interior lamps, HVAC       
  system, etc.) and close doors.
• Turn the accessories back on after programming has completed.
• Disconnect/depower any aftermarket accessories (remote start, alarm, power inverter , CB radio,etc.).
• Follow all scan tool on-screen instructions carefully.
• Disable FDRS/scan tool sleep mode, screensaver, hibernation modes.     
• Create all sessions key on engine off (KOEO). Starting the vehicle before creating a session will cause   
   errors within the programming inhale process.
Recovering a module when programming has resulted in a blank module
a. Disconnect the VCM II/VCM III or the VCMM from the data link connector (DLC) and your computer .
b. After ten seconds, reconnect the VCMII/VCMIII or the VCMM to the DLC and the PC. Launch FDRS.   
    The VCMII/VCMIII or the VCMM icon should turn green in the bottom right corner of the screen. If it 
    does not, troubleshoot the FDRS to VCM connection.  
c. If you are using the same FDRS as the initial programming attempt, select the appropriate VIN from   
    the Vehicle Identification menu. If you are using a different FDRS, select “Read VIN from Vehicle”  
    and proceed through the Network Test. 
d. In the Toolbox menu, navigate to the failed module and Download/Run Programmable Module    
    Installation (PMI). Follow the on-screen prompts. When asked if the original module is installed,         
    select “No” and continue through the installation application.
e. Once programming has completed, a screen may list additional steps required to complete the         
    programming process. Make sure all applicable steps are followed in order .
