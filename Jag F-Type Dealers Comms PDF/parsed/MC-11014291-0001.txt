Cause

This condition may be caused by the transmission pump bolts were not fully torqued.
CauseNote: Service replacement transmission assemblies received may be built in the same
Julian date range. If that occurs replacement of the pump bolts must be performed before
the transmission is installed in the vehicle.
For Transmission Julian Date, refer to Transmission Identification Information  in SI.
Check transmission Julian build date:
• If the transmission Julian date is between 24 160 and 24 311 and the vehicle comes in
with a transmission leak in the torque converter housing area, order the bolt kit as re-
quired.
Note: Example TUN where Julian date is found: 13241794TKBP0151 (Date
Reads 13[24179]4TKBP0151).
• Once the bolt kit arrives, remove the transmission, and verify that the bolts are loose.
• If loose, replace all the bolts and reinstall the transmission.
