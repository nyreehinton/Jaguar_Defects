This do cument addresses various cracks in the lightweight exterior glass panes of the 911. 
This do cument is not applicable to cracks caused by external influence.
This do cument only applies to vehicles with the option VW4 – Lightweight and Noise Insulated Glass.
Technical Background  
The various types and causes of cracks in the lightweight exterior glass panes of the 911 are outlined below.
Door glass: Cracks in the top corner (driver or passenger side)
Ther e are two main causes for this condition:
-> The do or glass is misaligned, which can cause contact between the door glass and the rear quarter glass, or
->  F orce applied to the glass (i.e., instead of the door sill) throughout the door closing process can bend the  
gl ass enough to cause contact with the rear quarter glass, despite a proper window alignment with no force 
applied.
Up dated lightweight door glass parts have been developed to address this complaint. Please see the Door glass: 
crack s in the top corner section of the Service Information for repair instructions.
