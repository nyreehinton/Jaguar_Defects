Case Number:   S2519000001  Rev. A 
 
 
Release Date:   February 2025  
 
 
Symptom/Vehicle Issue : Steering Drift And Or Pull.  
 
 
Customer Complaint/T echnician Observation:  Vehicle steering drifts or pulls while 
driving.  
 
 
Discussion : When diagnosing a drif t or pull complaint  first verify tire condition and 
wheel alignment. Replace any tires damaged beyond servicing.  Damage  such as 
cupping , feathering, un even tread wear. Next, verify  wheel alignment . Once tires and 
alignment are verified as ok, compare the drift pull to a like vehicle. I f the customer 
vehicle  is comparable to a li ke truck, engineering is aware of complaints and actively  
investigating. A future service  publication will provide an update. Replacing the EPS at 
this time will not resolve the concern.
