DISCUSSION:
Please be advised that Oil Filter Assemblies (OFA) (Service P/N - 68596318AB)  are being unnecessarily
replaced for oil leaks at high rates.
Before replacing the OFA, ensure that the leak is properly diagnosed. This MUST  include using oil dye (P/N –
5010042AB)  to identify the leak’s source, per the oil leak diagnosis procedure.
If a leak is identified at the filter cap, replace the oil filter and the filter cap’s O-ring with the MOPAR service
kit (P/N - 68191349AC) and retest to resolve this. Some aftermarket filter and O-ring kits will not seal properly,
causing leaks. Warranty claims on failing aftermarket parts cannot be billed to Stellantis and will not be
validated. Do not replace the OFA for this issue.
If a leak is identified at the valve cover and causing pooled oil in the valley, replace with the appropriate valve
cover or gasket kit. Do not replace the OFA for this issue.
If a leak is identified from the bottom mating surfaces of the OFA to the block, use the MOPAR gasket kit (P/N
- 68191356AB) to resolve this. Do not replace the OFA for this issue.
If any other leak is identified, but cannot be traced to the OFA, do not replace the OFA for this issue.
Deviations from the oil leak diagnosis procedure causing any over-repair under warranty will not be validated
and the Dealer will cover the costs.
Unnecessary OFA replacement under warranty will not be validated and the Dealer will cover the costs.
