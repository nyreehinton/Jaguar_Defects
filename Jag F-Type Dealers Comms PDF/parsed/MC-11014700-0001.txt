The new Central Pressure Control (CPC) system has changed the way that the ABS
chuff test is performed. On initial key on the ABS goes through a pneumatic chuff test
where it activates the ABS modulators. The second portion of the test activates once
the driver applies the service brake. The system then performs a pneumatic and
electrical test that monitors system response while activating modulators such as Trailer
Pressure Modulator Valve (TPMV). This test is to verify electrical components along
with the pneumatic system pressures and exhaust are working correctly. 
 
There have been a few trucks that have not passed the chuff test due to hose
configuration and the software monitors not allowing for system or driver variables. This
ABS software and hardware change will address both.
 
 
 
 
Volvo Trucks without Hill Start Assist (HSA)
 
Relocate the vent by removing the mushroom vent from ATR6 valve control port and
run 3/8 line from the valve to any open port in the pass through air manifold mounted on
the bulkhead.

Configuration operation found in T ech T ool. The operation will download a
configuration file for the connected vehicle and initiate configuration of the ESP
feature via the Bendix® V endor Configuration Program (VCP).
 
A specific Bendix® VCP  package for Tech Tool must be installed on the PC prior to
performing an ESP  configuration. This software is not installed as part of Tech Tool and ;Live UI2/28/25, 10:22 AM Article

Network Connection at the V ehicle
 
In order to perform the ESP  Control Unit Configuration operation, it must be possible to
connect to the vehicle and the Central Systems at the same time. Therefore, it must be
possible for the PC to have a network (LAN or Wi-Fi) connection while also connected to
the vehicle’ s diagnostic connector .
 
 
 
Performing ESP Control Unit Configuration
 
After performing the actions outlined in the Preparation section above, connect the PC to
the vehicle’ s diagnostic connector and complete the vehicle identification process displayed
in Tech Tool’s ‘PRODUCT’  tab.
Make sure that the PC is able to connect to Central Systems via a
network/internet connection.
 
Select the “Calibrate” tab and expand group ‘5 – Brakes’  and open the ‘ESP
Control Unit Configuration’  operation. [see figure 4]
 
Figure 4
 
 
The ESP  Control Unit Configuration operation is structured as a checklist of actions,
similar to control unit software programming operations.  [see figure 5]

Start the operation by clicking the start button in the toolbar . After the conditions
are confirmed, the operation will read data from the vehicle. A connection to Central
Systems will be made in order to download the ESP  system configuration file for the
connected vehicle.
 
A window may open depending on what version of Tech Tool is being used. Select either
option and hit OK.
 
 
After the ESP  system configuration file is downloaded, a configuration window
containing a status bar will appear while the ESP  control unit is configured.  [see
figure 6];Live UI2/28/25, 10:22 AM Article

Note:  On some occasions, the status bar window may appear blank. Although it
appears that no action is occurring, the process is proceeding. In this case, allow the
process to continue. The ABS ECU will be restarted and the configuration window will
disappear when its task is complete and the process will continue in the main
operation window .
 
Figure 6
 
After the configuration is complete, the configuration window will be closed and
another connection to Central Systems will be made in order to send a confirmation
that the configuration has been completed successfully .
 
Once the configuration has been completed verify that the system air is fully charged. Apply
ignition power and wait 30 seconds.  
 
1.  Use Bendix ACom Pro Diagnostic Software or ACom Diagnostic Software V6.7.2.5 (or
higher) to clear the active pressure sensor DTC.
 
2.  Carrying out the demand pressure sensor initialization procedure which involves
applying service brakes of 90 psi or greater for three (3) seconds (while stationary).
 
Once this procedure is carried out successfully , if there are no other active
DTCs, the ATC/ESP  indicator lamp will no longer be illuminated.
 
 
 
 
 
 
If fault code SPN807 FMI 13 is still present or active
after a road test please follow the steps below.
1. Pull ECU80 ACOM report (HTML Format) and attach to SR case
2. Chock the truck so there is no concern about rolling.;Live UI2/28/25, 10:22 AM Article

3. Hook up ACOM and clear DTC’s: SPN 807 FMI 13
4. Run the chuff test two times and check to see if fault code SPN 807 FMI 13 comes
active
 
Chuff Test:
a. Key on and let the traditional chuff test complete.
b. Make a moderate brake application and release. No need to release the
parking brake
5. If a fault becomes active proceed to step 6. If the fault does not reoccur proceed to
step 7
6. Remove anything connected to the ATR-6 control port so it is open right at the ATR-
6.
a. Trucks built with HSA, pulling the tube out of the fitting should suffice. HSA will
not pneumatically function, but it is not activated during the chuff test so the open
tubing will not blast air during this procedure.
b. Trucks built without HSA, remove the vent “mushroom cap” fitting to be taken
out in case it is not venting properly.
7. Hook up ACOM and pull up a pressure test monitor PS1 and PS2 sensors while
running tests.
8. Apply service brake and watch both sensors to see that the pressure rise and fall
simultaneously
9. Perform and record Chuff Test and include it into SR case
10. PS2 sensor should be slightly delayed of PS1 during this test. If PS2 is holding
pressure Check to see if the air is present by adding a pressure gauge tee in line with
the PS2 sensor and watching to see if the pressure drops off at the gauge.
11. Make sure the added gauge and the ACOM PS2 gauge pressures rise and fall at
the same time. The gauges may or may not match pressures but they both should be
near zero after the chuff test.
12. Checking PS2 Sensor: If ACOM shows that there is still a pressure check PS2 and
the added gauge shows zero. Check the sensor to see if wires are pulled tight against
the senor sideloading the sensor wire seals at the connector, verify that terminals are
not spread. Verify that the circuits do not contain any cuts or abrasions. Replace sensor
and calibrate by applying service brakes of 90 psi or greater for three (3) seconds
(while stationary)
13. Checking HSA and ATR6 Piping: If both the added gauge and the ACOM PS2
sensor show pressure dropping at the same time, perform step 6.
14. Rerun chuff test. If the pressure is still not dropping at the gauge and ACOM PS2
sensor still shows pressure
15. Check the delivery hose to see if the hose is kinked or pinched.
16. If there is air at the switch identify the source of where the air is not being
exhausted. Check Trailer Pressure Modulator Valve to make sure there is no air at DEL
port or coming back from the tractor protection valve. Inspect all airlines for sharp
bends, pinches, or kinks.
