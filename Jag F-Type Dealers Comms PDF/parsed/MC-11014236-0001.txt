AEWP INSPECTION AND REPLACEMENT  (SC325) 
 
This bulletin provides information to inspect and, if necessary, replace the Auxiliary Electric Water Pump (AEWP), 
control harness wiring, and/or engine room junction box for coolant intrusion and/or corrosion on certain 2022 -
2023MY Kia Hybrid and Plug -in Hybrid vehicle s listed in the table below. The AEWP in the subject vehicles may 
crack internally and allow coolant to intrude into the AEWP circuitry. If coolant enters the AEWP circuitry,  the 
Check Engine Light (CEL) may be illuminated with one or more DT Cs listed on page 2 . If the vehicle continues 
to be driven in this condition, the Active Air Flap (AAF) warning message can also activate, and coolant may 
eventually migrate through the wiring harness to the engine room junction block. This may result in a reduction 
of motive power and may cause the vehicle to release air pollutants which exceeds Federal and California 
standards. These standards were established to protect the public health and welfare from the dangers of air 
pollution. Follow th e procedure outlined in this publication to inspect for a related DTC(s) stored and coolant 
leaking into the AEWP harness wiring connector on the applicable vehicle. Depending on the inspection result, 
replacement of the AEWP may be required, along with po ssible Control Harness wiring and PCB block assembly. 
Before conducting the procedure, verify that the vehicle is included in the list of affected VINs.
