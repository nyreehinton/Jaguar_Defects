Attention: Parts Manager/Parts Specialist
Since model year 2015, nearly all new vehicles (SUV's may have Thatcham or 
previous style wheel lock) come equipped with Thatcham-style wheel locks from the 
factory.  Each vehicle equipped with Thatcham-style wheel locks uses a unique key.
For this reason, a master key set is not available. Replacement wheel lock keys and/
or lug bolts should be ordered by the following process:
Replacement Instructions:
If a Thatcham-style wheel lock key is broken, or if a lug bolt is broken or missing, 
submit a PRMS ticket with the following details:
1. Classification: Parts Support
2. Classification: Order Processing
3. Request Type: Order Creation
4. Short Problem Description: "TLK"
Include the code stamped on the wheel lock key (e.g., "ABC P12074"; see Figure 1) 
or a high-resolution photo (See Figure 2) of the wheel bolt.
Replacement keys and/ or lug bolt(s) will be shipped directly from the wheel lock 
manufacturer in Germany to PCNA. PCNA will then forward the key to your Porsche 
Center and your parts statement will be billed.
Please note change in procedure to order 
a coded wheel nut from Thatcham. 
We hope this process will make for better tracking and improved delivery times.  
Please use this three-step process, effective immediately.
Thank you for your business and support of the Porsche brand.
