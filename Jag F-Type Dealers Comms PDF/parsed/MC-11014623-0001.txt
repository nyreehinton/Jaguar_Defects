Correction:    
Test and charge the battery .
Important: The battery must be fully charged before cycling the fuse. The module must see
a fully charged battery before cycling the fuse to get it out of the reboot loop.
Once battery is full voltage, locate the F6DA fuse in the X51A Instrument P anel Wiring
Harness Junction Block. Remove the fuse to reset the module and plug the fuse back in.
Important:  The vehicle will still need to be tested / diagnosed to see why the battery went
low below 4 volts.
Engineering is currently investigating .
