Correction:  
To correct this concern, repair any loss of communication or door ajar DTC's ﬁrst, and then
reevaluate the air suspension operation.

would mislead a tech to believe the system is in good working order , when it is not.   
Tip:  When monitoring the door ajar parameters, open and close each door and mak e sure
the data matches the door position.
Note: This condition has been seen on vehicles that have been upﬁtted, examples armored
vehicles, limos, etc.
