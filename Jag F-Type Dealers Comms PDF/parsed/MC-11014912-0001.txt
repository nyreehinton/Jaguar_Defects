EXCESSIVE OIL CONSUMPTION  
NU/GAMMA/THETA/KAPPA ENGINES  
 
 
This bulletin provides information on diagnosing and/or repairing some 2011 -2024MY vehicles  (refer to the tables 
on pages 8 -9 for applicable models and engine), which may exhibit a symptom of excessive oil consumption. Follow 
the flowchart on page 2 in this procedure to repair a vehicle exhibiting excessive oil consumption.   
 
Engine Oil Maintenance:  
• Engine oil is responsible for lubrication, cooling, and operation of hydraulic components of the engine. Engine oil is expected to be consumed in normally operating engines. Therefore, regular ly checking  oil level 
and regular oil changes are required as part of the factory maintenance schedule.  
• The purpose of oil changes is to prevent oil deterioration. A separate requirement is to maintain the oil level, 
independent of the oil change interval. It is necessary to check the oil level at every fueling stop and 
replenish the oil, if necessary. This is one of several check items that the owner’s manual recommends at 
every fueling stop.  
• Operation with deteriorated or low engine oil causes reduced lubrication and cooling, as well as impaired operation of hydraulic components. This leads to abnormal wear of engine parts, oversaturation of carbon, 
and deposits of oil sludge. These can result  in damage to multiple areas of the engine, ultimately requiring 
a costly, lengthy, and preventable repair.

EXCESSIVE OIL CONSUMPTION - NU/GAMMA/THETA/KAPPA ENGINES  
 SUBJECT:  
Oil Consumption Test : 
Engine Oil Inspection (Preparation for Test 1)  
1. Check if there is an oil leak. ( Note : If an oil leak if confirmed, the oil leak source needs to be repaired prior 
to performing the outlined procedure in this publication).  
 
2. Turn the engine ‘ON’ for about 10- 15 minutes until the engine reaches normal operating temperature. 
Ensure the temperature gauge reads at the 1/2 mark.  
 
3. Turn the engine ‘OFF’ and open the oil filler cap. ( Note:  Wait for the engine oil to drop to the oil pan for 
about 15 minutes).  
 
4. Check the oil level using the oil level gauge/dipstick and document the reading in the RO.  
 
5. If engine oil top off is required, fill the engine oil to the ‘F’ (Full) line on the level gauge/dipstick. Refer to 
page 6, step 10 for required oil type and viscosity.  
 
6. Re-install the engine oil filler cap and oil level gauge and apply a tamper evident silicone seal to the drain 
plug, oil filter, dipstick and oil cap. Vehicle Out 1 . 
B) Engine Oil Inspection (After 1K Miles of Driving)  
1. Repeat steps from section A. 1 -4. Refill the engine oil up to the ‘F’ (Full) line of the oil level gauge/dipstick.  
 
2. Refer to page 6, step 10 for required oil type and viscosity.  
 
3. Calculate the oil consumption amount as follows (Result = Refer to Flowchart  on page 2 ): 
 
• If the oil consumption amount is less than 1qt/1,000 miles, Normal  consumption, No Repair . 
• If the oil consumption amount is over 1qt/1,000 miles, Excessive  perform Repair 1  (Clean Combustion 
Chamber, pages 4 -6). 
• Replace the engine oil, oil filter and gasket and apply a tamper evident silicone seal to the drain plug, oil filter, dipstick and oil cap.  
4. Top-off the engine oil to the ‘F’ (Full) line of the oil level gauge/dipstick. Refer to page 6, step 10 for required 
oil type and viscosity.  
 
5. Re-install the engine oil filler cap and oil level gauge/dipstick. Vehicle Out 2 . 
C) Engine Oil Inspection (After Repair 1 and 1,000 Miles of Driving)  
1. Repeat steps from section B. 1 -2. 
• If the oil consumption amount is less than 1qt/1,000 miles, Normal  consumption, No Repair  
• If the oil consumption amount is over 1qt/1,000 miles, Excessive  perform Repair 2  
(Engine R&R, page 7 ). 
 
2. Top-off the engine oil to the ‘F’ (Full) fill line of the oil level gauge/dipstick. Refer to page 7, step 1 for 
required oil type and viscosity.  
 
3. Re-install the engine oil filler cap and oil level gauge/dipstick.  Vehicle Out 3 .
