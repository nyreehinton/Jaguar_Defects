 SUBJECT: Door Window Regulator- Erratic Operation
INTRODUCTION:
This bulletin announces availability of new door window regulator assemblies and door glass run 
channel seals in response to limited concerns of erratic operation of the anti-entrapment feature 
and/or the door glass either not closing or closing very slowly. The change was made to control the 
upper mount of the regulator which allows the glass to ride in the center of the sash frame and not 
rotate on the frame causing a binding condition. In addition, the production process of the door glass 
run channel seal has been improved to provide added rigidity to the seal allowing to more steadily 
maintain its shape. If erratic window operation is reported by a customer, refer to the parts and repair 
procedure information outlined in this bulletin.

LEGACY & OUTBACK
NOTE: The regulator and motor have been incorporated into vehicle production as per starting VIN 
M3002014 for Legacy and M3100848 for Outback.
This Service Procedure involves pre-inspection of the regulator assembly and the replacement 
corresponding glass run channel and their replacement when determined necessary.
STEP 1:  Remove the affected  window regulator assembly from the door following the procedure in 
the applicable STIS Service Manual.  REMINDER : Use all precautions when working with these 
highly visible interior trim panels to protect them from damage.
Bulletin Number: 07-189-21R;  Revised: 02/17/25         Page 3 of 4
STEP 2:  Measure the regulator upper roller frame to confirm the regulator was correctly assembled. 
If the measured distance between the outside of the rail guide (see dashed line below) and the outer 
side of the mounting nut is not within 24.5 to 25.5mm, the regulator will require replacement. A 
30mm wide ruler is recommended.
IMPORTANT NOTE: ALWAYS  confirm there is no gap between ruler and the frame. 
STEP 3:  When inspection determines window regulator replacement is required, the door glass 
run channel seal will also require replacement. See the example photo below of the door glass run 
channel seal.
The service procedures for window regulator assembly and door glass run channel replacement 
remain unchanged.  Always refer to STIS and review the full requirements of the repair being 
performed.  The Service Manual procedures contain information critical to performing an effective 
repair the first time, every time.  This includes but is not limited to important SAFETY precautions, 
proper inspection criteria, necessary special tools, required processes and related one-time-use parts 
needed for a complete and lasting repair.
