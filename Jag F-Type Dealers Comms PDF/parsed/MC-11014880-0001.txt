2GENERAL SAFETY GUIDELINES
WARNING! PLEASE READ AND FOLLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS
TO AVOID PERSONAL INJURY OR DEATH:
When working on or around a vehicle, the following guidelines should be observed AT ALL TIMES :
 ▲ Park the vehicle on a level surface, apply the 
parking brakes, and always block the wheels.  
Always wear personal protection equipment.  
 ▲Stop the engine and remove the ignition key 
when working under or around the vehicle.  
When working in the engine compartment, 
the  engine  should  be  shut  off   and  the  ignition 
key should be removed. Where circumstances 
require that the engine be in operation, EXTREME 
CAUTION  should be used to prevent personal 
injury resulting from contact with moving, 
rotating, leaking, heated, or electrically charged 
components.
 ▲Do not attempt to install, remove, disassemble, 
or assemble a component until you have read, 
and thoroughly understand, the recommended 
procedures. Use only the proper tools and 
observe all precautions pertaining to use of those 
tools.
 ▲If the work is being performed on the vehicle’s 
air brake system, or any auxiliary pressurized air 
systems, make certain to drain the air pressure 
from all reservoirs before beginning ANY  work 
on the vehicle.  If the vehicle is equipped with 
a Bendix® AD-IS® air dryer system, a Bendix® 
DRM™ dryer reservoir module, a Bendix® AD-9si®, 
AD-HF®, or AD-HFi® air dryer, be sure to drain the 
purge reservoir.
 ▲Following the vehicle manufacturer’s 
recommended procedures, deactivate the 
electrical system in a manner that safely removes 
all electrical power from the vehicle.
 ▲Never exceed manufacturer’s recommended 
pressures.   ▲Never connect or disconnect a hose or line 
containing pressure; it may whip and/or cause 
hazardous airborne dust and dirt particles. Wear 
eye protection. Slowly open connections with 
care, and verify that no pressure is present. Never 
remove a component or plug unless you are 
certain all system pressure has been depleted.
 ▲ Use only genuine Bendix® brand replacement 
parts, components, and kits. Replacement 
hardware, tubing, hose, fittings, wiring, etc. 
must be of equivalent size, type, and strength as 
original equipment and be designed specifi  cally 
for such applications and systems.
 ▲Components with stripped threads or damaged 
parts should be replaced rather than repaired.  
Do not attempt repairs requiring machining or 
welding unless specifi  cally stated and approved 
by the vehicle and component manufacturer.
 ▲Prior to returning the vehicle to service, make 
certain all components and systems are restored 
to their proper operating condition.
 ▲ For vehicles with Automatic Traction Control 
(ATC), the ATC function must be disabled (ATC 
indicator lamp should be ON) prior to performing 
any vehicle maintenance where one or more 
wheels on a drive axle are lifted off   the ground 
and moving.
 ▲The power MUST be temporarily disconnected 
from the radar sensor whenever any tests USING 
A DYNAMOMETER are conducted on a vehicle 
equipped with a Bendix® Wingman® system.
 ▲ You should consult the vehicle manufacturer's operating and service manuals, and any related literature, 
in conjunction with the Guidelines above.
 
Improper use and/or maintenance of the Bendix® Fusion™ Active Safety System can result in a collision causing 
property damage, serious injuries, or death. Be sure to read, understand, and carefully follow the instructions 
in the applicable Fusion Operator’s Manual on B2Bendix.com.
 
Due to the inherent limitations of image recognition technology, camera-based safety technology — on rare 
occasions — may not be able to detect or may misinterpret lane markings. At these times, alerts may not 
occur, or erroneous alerts may occur.
 IMPORT ANT
It is the responsibility of the driver to remain vigilant and change driving practices depending on traffic and 
road conditions.1.1

Camera part number:
Look for the Bendix® 
brand logo on the 
camera label. Refer to 
Section 3.0  for how to 
remove the camera from  
the bracket to view  
the label.
 IMPORT ANT
For some Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) of the vehicle is 
stored in the FLC-25’s internal memory, and is cross-checked by the FLC-25 using information obtained from 
other vehicle controller(s). If the VIN stored in the FLC-25 does not match the VIN obtained from the other vehicle 
controller(s), the FLC-25 will generate a VIN Mismatch DTC .
42.0 TROUBLESHOOTING
Read and follow the General Safety Guidelines shown in 
this document.
 IMPORT ANT
All vehicle DTCs related to the engine, transmission, 
instrument cluster, engine cruise control, and Bendix® 
Antilock Braking System (ABS), Automatic Traction 
Control (ATC), or Electronic Stability Program (ESP®) 
systems must first be resolved, with no DTCs present 
during the vehicle operation while in cruise control, 
before trying to resolve camera DTCs.
 
If a problem with the FLC-25 camera is detected, 
reduced performance may occur, up to and including 
loss of Automated Emergency Braking (AEB). The 
vehicle should be serviced as soon as possible to 
restore full functionality.
2.1  TEMPORARILY DISABLE THE LANE 
DEPARTURE WARNING (LDW)
To avoid erroneous LDW warnings in areas such as 
construction zones – where the non-standard or overlapping 
road markings present might cause false alerts – the Fusion 
Active Safety System has an enable/disable switch. The 
Bendix switch design or a similar Original Equipment 
Manufacturer (OEM) switch may be used. See Figure 3 .
For vehicles that have the LDW switch hard-wired to the 
SafetyDirect® by Rand McNally® Web Portal Processor, 
and a functioning On Board Computer (OBC)/Telematics 
system: The enable/disable switch used by the LDW 
system also functions – when depressed for six (6) seconds 
– to activate a manual request to transmit the last five 
seconds and next five seconds of buffered video data.
Figure 3 – Example of an LDW Enable/Disable Switch2.2  SETTING DIAGNOSTIC 
TROUBLE CODES (DTC s)
If, during operation, the Fusion system detects a problem 
with the FLC-25 camera, a DTC will be set and – depending 
on the OEM – the driver will be alerted on the dash display 
with an icon or similar method. In these cases, some 
features of the Fusion system will not be available. 
For example, if – for an extended period of time – the 
system detects that the camera is blocked by dirt, snow, 
ice, etc., a DTC will typically be set. 
2.3  BENDIX® ACOM® DIAGNOSTIC

272.7  COMMUNICATIONS (J1939 
AND PRIVATE) TEST AND 
TROUBLESHOOTING PROCEDURES
The Bendix FLC-25 camera requires private network 
messages to and from the Fusion system. The camera will 
set a DTC if these messages are not present, or if there is 
a problem with the private communications system. Refer 
to SD-29-50022, Bendix® Fusion™ FLR-25™ Radar Sensor, 
on B2Bendix.com for full troubleshooting information.
NOTE:  Confirm there are no DTCs on other components. 
If there are active DTCs, they should be addressed prior to 
performing additional troubleshooting procedures.  
1. Take all measurements at the harness connector unless 
otherwise indicated.
 
Do not insert any probe into the pin on the mating 
connector of the camera that is greater than the width 
of a terminal. Damaged connector pins will require the 
replacement of the harness.
2.  Check for damaged or reversed private communications 
wiring.
  If the private communications HIGH, or private 
communications LOW, wiring circuits are damaged, such 
as shorting together, the entire private communications 
link will be lost. The problem may be intermittent, 
enabling the private communications link to operate 
normally sometimes. In this event, multiple DTCs may 
be logged in the camera and radar.
  If the private communications HIGH, and private 
communications LOW, wiring circuits are reversed, 
communication over the entire private communications 
link will be lost. Devices that use the affected network 
will not be able to transmit or receive messages on that 
network.
3.  Check for corroded or damaged wiring connector 
problems such as opens or shorts to voltage or ground.
4.  If the connector terminals are corroded, this may be an 
indication of water intrusion into the wiring system and 
possibly the camera. Replacement of the entire harness 
is recommended. If the terminals of the camera are 
corroded, replacement of the camera is recommended.
5.  Check for other private communications devices 
which may be inhibiting communication. The service 
technician should consult the procedures for private 
communications troubleshooting. The device’s power 
should be removed and measurements made at the 
ECU pins for shorts to ground and power pins and 
resistance between the private communications HIGH 
or private communications LOW input circuits.6.  Unplug the camera harness. With the ignition switch 
off, measure the resistance (ohms) using a multimeter. 
•  Private Communications: Measure the resistance 
between harness pins 2 and 8. The reading should 
be approximately 120 ohms. If it is not, the vehicle 
wiring should be investigated.
•  J1939: Measure the resistance between harness 
pins 3 and 9. The reading should be 0 ohms. If it 
is not, the vehicle wiring should be investigated.
2.8  PRIVATE COMMUNICATIONS 
NETWORK TEST PROCEDURE 
The Bendix FLC-25 camera requires private network 
messages to and from the Fusion system. The camera will 
set a DTC if these messages are not present, or if there is 
a problem with the private communications system . 
Refer to SD-29-50022, Bendix® Fusion™ FLR-25™ 
Radar Sensor, on B2Bendix.com for full troubleshooting 
information.
2.9  TROUBLESHOOTING 
WIRING HARNESSES
All wire harness connectors must be properly seated to 
maintain electrical connectivity. Push the mating connectors 
until they click. When replacing an FLC-25 camera, check 
that the wire harness connectors are free of damage, 
including corrosion, before plugging into a new camera. 
Check for corroded or damaged wiring connector problems 
such as opens or shorts to voltage or ground.
If the connector terminals are corroded, this may be an 
indication of water intrusion into the wiring system and 
possibly into the camera (presumably from a cracked 
windshield). Replacement of the entire harness is 
recommended. If the terminals of the camera are corroded, 
replacement of the camera is recommended.
2.10  CLEARING DIAGNOSTIC 
TROUBLE CODES (DTCS)
Cycle the ignition power, or use the ACom Diagnostic 
Software to clear DTCs after troubleshooting – and 
correcting – any problem with the system.
283.0 INSTALLATION AND REPLACEMENT 
Refer to OEM documentation for mounting specifications. 
 
Whenever re-installing or replacing a camera – 
for example, after a windshield is replaced – the 
recommended position for the vehicle must be used. 
Failure to install the camera in the correct position can 
result in system DTCs being set, system performance 
degradation, and/or a collision causing property 
damage, serious injuries, or death.
Contact the OEM for specific location coordinates of 
the windshield where the camera should be installed.
BRACKET INSTALLATION
The bracket should be installed by the windshield supplier 
or per the OEM-recommended installer. CAMERA INSTALLATION
In instances where a third-party bracket and/or cover 
is used, follow the applicable OEM instructions. If a 
Bendix bracket and/or cover is used, refer to the following 
procedures. 
NOTE: A Bendix bracket and cover can be identified by 
a Knorr-Bremse® logo on the component. See Figure 5. 
Figure 5 – Bendix Bracket and Cover PN Location
1. Hold the camera in a lens-up orientation. Referring to 
Figure 6 , insert the tabs (A) into the slots (B).
Figure 6 – Camera Installation
292. Rotate the camera counterclockwise (when viewed 
from the left [driver] side) until the tabs (C) contact 
the clips (D). 
3. Push the camera down so that the clips (D) are 
displaced by the tabs (C), therefore seating the camera. 
The clips will audibly click when the tabs reach the 
correct position and the clips spring into a locked 
position, retaining the camera. See Figure 7.  
Figure 7 – Camera Aligned
4. In some cases, the clips will not “click” into position. 
Verify that the clips are in the locked position as shown 
in Figure 8.  Sometimes it is necessary to pry the clips 
into the final locked position. In most cases, this can 
be done using finger pressure. In some cases, needle-
nose pliers or small screw drivers may be needed.  
Figure 8 – Clips in Locked Position
NOTE:  Due to proximity to the headliner, it may be 
necessary to use an inspection mirror to verify the clips 
are locked.
COVER INSTALLATION
See Figure 9. 
1. Line up the large “ears” on the bracket with the slots 
in the cover. 
2. Align the cylindrical tabs A and A with slots B and B 
in the cover.
3. Gently push the cover onto the bracket. The front 
surface of the cover will be flush with the back surface 
of the bracket when the tabs are properly aligned and 
seated. 
4. Pull the cover down locking it in position. There will be 
an audible click when the cover fully seats.

30BRACKET REMOVAL
The bracket should be removed per OEM recommendations. 
COVER AND CAMERA REMOVAL 
The camera is most easily removed from the holder if it is 
removed from the bracket assembly. This will depend upon 
the proximity of the headliner. In most cases, there will not 
be sufficient clearance to access the clips that retain the 
camera in the holder. 
1. Begin by removing the cover from the camera. This is 
the reverse of installation. Push the cover up. Once the 
cover is moved upward, it can be pulled back, and off 
the bracket assembly. Take note of the holder position.
2. Remove the electrical connectors with attached wiring 
from the camera. The connectors have locking features 
that require squeezing them to facilitate removal. 
3.  See Figure 10. Use a screwdriver to pry the locking 
beam (A) away from the hub (B) on the right side of 
the bracket. 
Figure 10 – Camera Removal
4. Once the hub (B) is released from the beam (A), the 
right side of the holder with the camera can be pulled 
back from the bracket assembly. This will allow the 
entire holder and camera to be removed from the 
bracket assembly.
5. Once on the bench, the clips can be released from the 
tabs on the camera body. Push on the clips as indicated 
by the arrows in Figure 11. 
Figure 11 – Camera Removal
6. Once the clips are released, the camera can be rotated 
up and out of the clips. This may require the use of 
screwdrivers to pry the camera from the clips. 
 
Do NOT pry between the bottom of the camera and the 
holder with tools. It is easily broken.
7. Check the holder for damage. If there is no damage, 
return the holder to the bracket. Note that the hubs on 
the holder fit into slots on the bracket and then can be 
slid into place. Start with the hub on the right (curb) 
side of the bracket. Once it is seated, push the other 
side home, engaging the teeth on the holder with the 
threads on the worm shaft. 
318. It may be necessary to adjust the holder position back 
to its initial position as previously noted ( Step 1 ).

3.1 CAMERA CALIBRATION 
Calibration is done as part of initial drive for service 
cameras. It may take up to 20 minutes of driving above  
25 mph (40 kph) on well-marked roads in clear weather for 
the camera to be ready and fully calibrated. The camera 
should not be returned for any calibration faults found in 
this time period. If a calibration fault appears while driving, 
check the camera for looseness or misalignment and 
continue driving to clear the fault. 
3.2 DASH SWITCH/LAMPS
Each OEM has their own method for displaying the system 
status to the driver, and there will typically will be a switch 
on the dash to allow the driver to temporarily disable the 
system. Refer to the OEM Operator’s Manual  for system 
indicator lamp(s) used for the FLC-25 camera, and whether 
there is a bulb-check illumination at vehicle power-up. 
Additionally, the system self-monitors and will set a DTC 
that will typically alert the driver using a similar icon on 
the dash display or by a status lamp. Refer to Section 2.0: 
Troubleshooting  for more information.
3.3 MAINTENANCE
In normal use, the FLC-25 camera needs only a clean, 
properly maintained windshield to ensure a clear view of 
the road ahead. Protect the camera lens whenever the 
inside of the windshield is cleaned. 
3.4 CAMERA INTERCHANGEABILITY 
When replacing cameras only, use replacements with the 
same part number (or a direct superseding replacement 
number supplied by Bendix). After replacing the camera, 
run the engine for two (2) minutes and verify no faults are 
present. Once confirmed no faults are shown with the 
engine running, drive the vehicle for 5-20 miles (8-32 km) 
or until the camera calibration fault is no longer indicated.
 
Cameras of different vehicle models and model 
years must not be interchanged. The use of an 
incorrect camera can lead to DTCs being set, and 
performance degradation – including unnecessary 
system interventions and the potential for situations 
where interventions do not occur when they would 
normally.
Cameras are designed specifically for a particular 
vehicle and model. DTCs caused by relocating cameras 
to an incorrect vehicle may result in the vehicle system 
using the camera to be partially or fully unavailable.
