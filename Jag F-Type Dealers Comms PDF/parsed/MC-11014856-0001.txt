PRODUCT CAMPAIGN BULLETIN
INTRODUCTION
Subaru of America, Inc. (SOA) has determined that affected vehicles, listed below, may have been 
manufactured with improperly applied paint to the rear suspension sub-frame. If an affected vehicle is 
operated for an extensive period in a “salt-belt” area (see list of states below that use large amounts of 
salt on the roads in the winter), continued exposure to the salt could cause the rear sub-frame to rust-
out and possibly break. If the rear sub-frame were to rust-out and break, control of the vehicle could 
be affected.
This recall will involve cleaning and applying rust proofing material at the affected area.
AFFECTED VEHICLES
All 2000, all 2001 and most 2002 model year Legacy/Outback vehicles (and approximately 45 very 
early production 2003 Legacy, Outback and BAJA models) are affected. This recall will be limited 
to vehicles in regional areas known as “salt-belt” states and affects vehicles originally sold in or 
currently registered in the states of:
Connecticut Kentucky Missouri Rhode  Island
Delaware Maine New Hampshire Vermont
District  of Columbia Maryland New Jersey Virginia
Illinois Massachusetts New York West Virginia
Indiana Michigan Ohio Wisconsin
Iowa Minnesota Pennsylvania
Affected vehicles are identified in the VIN range chart on the following page. NOTE: Coverage 
for all affected vehicles must be confirmed by using the Vehicle Coverage Inquiry in the Dealer 
Communication System (DCS).

OWNER NOTIFICATION
Notification letters will be sent to owners of vehicles originally sold in or currently registered in “salt-
belt” states. SOA will prepare and mail those letters on or around July 7, 2003. A copy of the Owner 
Notification Letter is included at the end of this bulletin.
OWNERS LOCATED OUTSIDE THE AFFECTED “SALT-BELT” STATES
Notification letters will only be mailed to owners of vehicles that were originally sold, or at one time 
registered, in “salt-belt” states.
After release of this recall, vehicles previously registered in a non-“salt-belt” state may relocate into 
a “salt-belt” area. In some cases, the vehicle may be registered in a “non-salt belt” state, and driven in 
a “salt-belt” area. These vehicles may not show coverage when checked using the Vehicle Coverage 
Inquiry in the Dealer Communication System (DCS). SOA requests that dealers located in “salt-belt” 
states check all vehicles within the affected VIN range for recall coverage. If it is determined that an 
owner of a vehicle, within the affected VIN range, relocates or uses the vehicle in a “salt-belt” area, 
dealers are requested to contact the CDS department at 1-800-782-2783 and request a WWM-96 
recall control number be issued. The dealer should perform this procedure on the vehicle at no cost to 
the customer.
DEALER PROGRAM RESPONSIBILITY
Dealers are to promptly service all vehicles subject to this recall at no charge to the vehicle owner 
regardless of mileage, age of the vehicle, or ownership.
For affected vehicles sold after the date on the dealer’s computer list, dealers are to contact those 
owners and provide them with a copy of the owner notification letter. They should also arrange to 
make the required correction according to the instructions in the service procedure section of this

SPRAY EQUIPMENT OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS
The pressure pot is equipped with an adjustment valve (or stop screw) to adjust the ratio of product to 
air. This adjustment valve will have to be adjusted in order to achieve optimal spray pattern for each 
material. The adjustment valve is identified in the diagram below.
Before filling the gun, turn the stop screw clockwise until completely closed. Draw a line down the 
middle of the stop screw using a marker. This line will be used to determine the number of turns 
needed for optimal spray of the waxes.

(Note: Product should be room temperature for proper application.)
When using the 360o flexible wand, turn the stop screw counterclockwise 3 turns from closed, and 
adjust the air pressure to 80 psi.
When using the 90o hook wand, turn the stop screw counterclockwise 3 turns from closed, and adjust 
the air pressure to 80 psi.
Gun Disassembly And Cleanout
Important: The spray equipment must be cleaned between vehicle applications. X-121B (Black 
Wax) must be removed from the gun and lines prior to applying the X-121 (Oil) to the next vehicle. 
Use the following procedure for equipment cleaning.
1. Turn the spray gun stop screw (as pictured above) clockwise until completely closed.
2. Blow the 360o flexible and 90o hook wands clear with air by pulling the spray gun trigger.
3. Disconnect the gun from the air supply.
4. Remove the spray tube using the quick disconnect.
5. Relieve the pressure from the gun by slowly turning the paint pot to the left until all the air 
escapes. Do not use the gun trigger to relieve pressure from the pot. This will cause the wax to 
flow into the air line supply of the gun.
6. Remove the paint pot and drain any remaining wax. Rinse the pot with mineral spirit based 
solvent.
If the gun is to be stored for more than 4 weeks, completely clean the gun with mineral spirits. Always 
store the gun assembled. Do not soak the 360o flexible or 90o hook wands in solvent. Prolonged 
exposure to solvent will cause damage.

Important Safety Recall Notice  
Subaru Recall Campaign WWM-96  
NHTSA Recall No. 03V-153
July, 2003
Dear Subaru Owner:
This notice is sent to you in accordance with the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act.
SUBARU OF AMERICA, INC. has decided that a defect, which relates to motor vehicle safety, 
exists in some 2000-2003 model year Subaru Legacy, Outback and BAJA vehicles originally sold or 
currently registered in the states of:
Connecticut Kentucky Missouri Rhode Island
Delaware Maine New Hampshire Vermont
District of Columbia Maryland New Jersey Virginia
Illinois Massachusetts New York West Virginia
Indiana Michigan Ohio Wisconsin
Iowa Minnesota Pennsylvania
DESCRIPTION OF THE SAFETY DEFECT
Subaru has determined that your vehicle may have been manufactured with a rear sub-frame 
assembly with poor paint quality. If the vehicle is operated for an extensive period in a “salt-belt” 
area (see list of states above that use salt on the roads in the winter), continued exposure to salt could 
cause the rear sub- frame assembly to rust-out and eventually break.
DESCRIPTION OF THE SAFETY HAZARD
The rear sub-frame assembly is part of your vehicle’s body and rear suspension. If the sub-frame 
assembly were to rust-out and break, control of the vehicle could be affected without prior warning, 
possibly resulting in a crash. If you encounter this situation, steer the vehicle off the roadway to a safe 
area in which to stop. Avoid sudden braking and steer straight ahead as you gradually slow down and 
move to a safe area.
REPAIRS
To prevent this condition from occurring, Subaru will clean and apply anti-rust material to the rear 
sub- frame assembly at no cost to you.
WHAT YOU SHOULD DO
You should immediately contact your Subaru Dealer for an appointment to have anti-rust material 
applied to your vehicle’s rear sub-frame at no cost to you.
Continued...
Bulletin Number: WWM-96R;  Revised: 02/10/25         Page 19 of 36
HOW LONG WILL THE REPAIR TAKE?
The actual time to clean and apply anti-rust material to the rear sub-frame assembly is approximately 
one hour. However, after the anti-rust material is applied, the vehicle should not be driven for at least 
one additional hour to allow time for the material to dry. Therefore, it may be necessary to leave your 
vehicle the full day of your scheduled appointment to allow your dealer flexibility in scheduling. 
Please present this letter to your Subaru Dealer at the time this repair procedure is performed.
IF YOU HA VE PREVIOUSLY PAID FOR A REPAIR
In the event that you have already paid for repairs associated with this condition, you may be eligible 
for reimbursement. The actual sum reimbursed will be equivalent to the amount Subaru of America 
would reimburse an authorized Subaru dealer in your area for the repair .
Please send the original service repair order, which has complete information including the name of 
the repair facility, date of repair, mileage at the time of repair, complete vehicle identification number 
(17 digits), and your name, with correct mailing address and telephone number to the address listed

5. Fire-fighting measures
Suitable (and unsuitable) extinguishing media:
Suitable extinguishing media: Use alcohol  resistant  foam, carbon dioxide,  dry chemical,    
     or water spray when fighting fires. Water or foam  may cause   
     frothing if liquid  is burning but it still may be a useful   
     extinguishing agent if carefully applied to the fire.
Unsuitable extinguishing media: Do not use water jet as an extinguisher, as this will spread    
     the fire.
Specific hazards arising  
from the chemical:    Vapors may be ignited by sparks, flames or other    
      sources of ignition if material is above the flash    
      point giving rise to a fire (Class B). Vapors are heavier than  
      air and may travel to a source of ignition and flash back.
      Empty containers that retain product residue (liquid, solid/  
      sludge, or vapor) can be dangerous. Do not pressurize, cut,   
      weld, braze, solder, drill, grind, or expose container to heat,  
      flame, sparks, static electricity, or other sources of ignition.   
      Any of these actions can potentially cause an explosion that  
      may lead to injury or death.
Hazardous combustion products: Carbon dioxide, Carbon monoxide
Special protective equipment and  
precautions for fire-fighters:   Do not enter fire area without proper protection    
      including self-contained breathing apparatus and   
      full protective equipment. Fight fire from a safe distance  
      and a protected location due to the potential of    
      hazardous vapors and decomposition products.    
      Use appropriate methods for the surrounding fire.
6. Accidental release measures
Personal precautions, protective equipment  
and emergency procedures:   No health effects expected from the clean-up of this    
      material if contact can be avoided. Follow personal    
      protective equipment recommendations found in Section   
      VIII of this SDS.

Inhalation: Move victim to fresh air and call emergency medical care. If not breathing, give artificial 
respiration; if breathing is difficult, give oxygen.
Eyes: In case of contact with material, immediately flush eyes with running water for at least 15 
minutes. Seek immediate medical attention.
Skin: Wash skin with soap and water. Remove and isolate contaminated clothing and shoes at the 
site.
Ingestion: DO NOT INDUCE VOMITING. Consult a physician. If vomiting occurs spontaneously, 
keep head below hips to prevent aspiration of liquid into the lungs.
SECTION 5: FIRE AND EXPLOSION HAZARD DATA
Flash Point: 105 oF. (TCC )
Explosive Limits:  LEL: 0.6  UEL: 7.0
EXTINGUISHING MEDIA:
Small Fires: Dry chemical, CO2, water spray, or regular foam.
Large Fires: Water spray, fog, or regular foam. Move container from fire area if you can do it without 
risk. Apply cooling water to sides of containers that are exposed to flames until well after fire is out. 
Stay away from ends of tanks. For massive fire in cargo area, use unmanned hose holder or monitor 
nozzles. If this is impossible, withdraw from area and let fire burn. Withdraw immediately in case of 
rising sound from venting safety device or any discoloration of tank due to fire.
Special Firefighting Protection/Emergency Action: Fire may produce irritating or poisonous 
gases. Positive pressure self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) and structural firefighters’ protective 
clothing will provide limited protection. Keep unnecessary people away; isolate hazard area and deny 
entry. If runoff from fire control occurs, notify the appropriate authorities.
Unusual Fire/Explosion Hazards: Flammable/combustible material; may be ignited by heat, sparks 
or flames. Vapors may travel to a source of ignition and flash back. Container may explode in heat 
of fire. Vapor explosion hazard indoors, outdoors or in sewers. Runoff to sewer may create fire or 
explosion hazard.
Products of Combustion:  Carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, oxides of sulfur, miscellaneous 
hydrocarbons.
SECTION 6: SPECIAL PRECAUTIONS AND SPILL/LEAK PROCEDURES
Steps to be Taken in case Material  is Released or Spilled: Shut off ignition sources; no flares, 
smoking or flames in hazard area. Stop leak if you can do it without risk.
Small Spills: Take up with sand or other noncombustible absorbent material and place into 
containers for later disposal.
Large Spills: Dike far ahead of liquid spill for later disposal.(PAGE 2 of 4)
