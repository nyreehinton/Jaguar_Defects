Please make sure you check your center ’s inventory as soon as possible.  You can see a list of af fected vehicles
in Inventory Campaign Details (ICD) under ROSS
 
For centers that qualify , this Service Action repair is eligible to be performed via Mobile Assistance
SITUA TION
For certain model vehicles with the S68T  engine, the Condition Based Service (CBS) data may show spark
plug replacement is due at a considerably “earlier” interval than specified in the Service and W arranty
Informational Booklet. 
 
CAUSE
Incorrect Condition Based Service (CBS) data were stored for the Spark Plug Replacement interval. 
 
Specifically , the initial mileage was set to 15,000 miles (~ 25,000 km) instead of the correct mileage value of
40,000 miles (~ 60,000 km).
 
CORRECTION
Reset the CBS data via IST A. 
 
PROCEDURE
Spark plug replacement SHOULD NOT  be performed in the af fected vehicles before the proper interval,
regardless of the CBS display . 
 
If a vehicle under this service action has a mileage over 14,000 miles, check the vehicle history to see if the
spark plug replacement was prematurely performed. 
 
If a spark plug replacement was already performed for this vehicle AND  the CBS data was previously reset,
no further action needs to be performed. Only the INITIAL  CBS Spark Plug interval is incorrect. The action of
resetting the spark plug CBS data will reset the spark plug maintenance interval to the correct value. You
can determine if a Spark Plug CBS reset has been done by the value of the Service Counter in the CBS
Reset test plan.

about:blank 1/6
If spark plug replacement has NOT  been carried out, then perform a correction of the spark plug
maintenance interval in the CBS data in the “Reset CBS Condition Based Service” and “CBS V ehicle Data
Correction” test plans as follows:
 
Connect the IST A diagnostic system to the vehicle 
Perform vehicle identification WITHOUT  vehicle testing
Select “V ehicle Management”
Select “Service Functions”
Select “Maintenance and Pre-Delivery Check”
 
Always connect a BMW -approved battery charger/power supply ( SI B04 23 10 ).
 
1. Select the test plan ABL-W AR-AS6100_CBS_RESET  – “Reset CBS Condition Based Service”. In the test plan, perform
the reset of the Spark Plug Service value. This action will reset the interval in the vehicle. The test plan can be ended after
this action.
 
 Note:  The CBS reset of the Spark Plug
maintenance interval may trigger a warning in
ISTA that the service was “not performed”.
 This may be displayed even though the reset
was carried out successfully . This is an error
in IST A and will be fixed with IST A version
4.52.2x (estimated release date of March 4,
2025).
 
 
 2. Next, select the test plan ABL-W AR-
AS6100_CBS_KORR – “CBS V ehicle Data
Correction”. Select the values for spark plug
service. These must be corrected since a spark
plug replacement was not actually performed in
the vehicle.
 
 
 3. Choose the option to “Re-enter the values
for Maintenance W ork”.

 4. In the text box for “Mileage of Last Service”,
enter the value of “0”. This is the correct value
since spark plug replacement has never
occurred. 
 
5. The next selection screen has you define
the value as KM or Miles. Either choice can
be selected as the value is “0”. 
 
6. The Service counter will be automatically
reduced back to 1 during this test plan. Select
“No” when asked if you want to alter the
Service Counter further . 
 
7. The Spark Plug Maintenance Interval will not display in the vehicle unless the service is triggered as “Due”. If the Spark
Plugs Replacement was showing “Due” in the vehicle, ensure that the display has reset to the correct value. If the Spark Plug
Replacement is still showing “Due” in the vehicle after this process, let the vehicle enter a sleep cycle and recheck.
