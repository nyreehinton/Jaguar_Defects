Digital Signal Processing Module (DSP) (Minor Feature Code IDBBN) No
Communication
Some 2024 Nautilus and 2025 Aviator vehicles equipped with a 24 channel audio digital signal processing
module (DSP) (minor feature code IDBBN) may exhibit a no audio/sound condition with no communication with
DSP. To confirm a vehicle is built with a certain minor feature code, review the build information by double-
clicking the vehicle identification number (VIN) in the upper left corner in the Professional Technician System
(PTS). This concern may be due to software in the DSP. To determine if it is a software concern, remove the
DSP fuse, F40 for Aviator or F138 for Nautilus, and inspect the fuse for an open and make sure the fuse has
proper blade contact. After one minute, reinstall the good fuse. If the concern is still present or a fuse concern
is found, continue with normal Workshop Manual diagnostics, Section 415-00 Information and Entertainment
System > General Information > Diagnosis and Testing. If communication has been re-established with the
DSP, reprogram the DSP using the latest software level of the Ford Diagnosis and Repair System (FDRS)
scan tool. For claiming, use causal part 18B849 and applicable labor operations in Section 10 of the Service
Labor Time Standards (SLTS) Manual.
