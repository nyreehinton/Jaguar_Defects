ConditionSome customers may comment that the MIL is illuminated.
Some technicians may comment on one or more of the following DTCs set in the Engine
Control Module:
• P11CC
• P22FB
• P2297
Some technicians may also find additional NOx related DTCs set.
CauseThis condition may be caused by one or more of the following:
• The EGR differential pressure sensor.
• EGR cooler contamination.
• The engine consuming coolant.
• The engine consuming excessive oil.
InformationIn the ECM, there is a set of calculations that estimate what the NOx sensor 1 should be
reading. This estimation is used in case there is a fault with the NOx sensor reading. This
estimate is shown in GDS2 as the Estimated Nitrogen Oxide Concentration. GDS2 also
has a Nitrogen Oxides Concentration Delta. This value represents the difference between
the measured NOx sensor concentration and the Estimated Nitrogen Oxide
Concentration. They are both located in Nitrogen Oxides Sensor Data. The DTCs above
set when the ECM detects NOx sensor 1 and the Estimated Nitrogen Oxide
Concentration are too far apart.
The most significant parameters used to calculate the Estimated Nitrogen Oxide
Concentration are:
• EGR Differential pressure sensor data
• Engine load
• EGR2 position
• Exhaust back pressure valve
 
Important: Service agents must comply with all International, Federal, State, Provincial, and/or Local laws
applicable to the activities it performs under this bulletin, including but not limited to handling, deploying,
preparing, classifying, packaging, marking, labeling, and shipping dangerous goods. In the event of a
conflict between the procedures set forth in this bulletin and the laws that apply to your dealership, you
must follow those applicable laws.
 
How to use this data
If you are working on a vehicle with one of the codes listed above, road test the vehicle and collect Nitrogen Oxides
Sensor Data. Review the data to see if Estimated Nitrogen Oxide Concentration is significantly higher for extended
periods compared to actual NOx levels measured at sensor 1.

1. Nitrogen Oxides Sensor Nitrogen Oxides Concentration - 230.7 ppm
2. Estimated Nitrogen Oxides Concentration - 1320.2 ppm
In this example you can see that the Estimated Nitrogen Oxide Concentration and the NOx value measured from the
NOx sensor are far apart. It is easy to see why the code set and that the Estimated Nitrogen Oxide Concentration is
skewed (1320.0 ppm), not the NOx sensor value.

1. Exhaust Gas Recirculation Pressure Sensor – 0.3 PSI
2. Exhaust Pressure Regulator Valve Position - 100%
3. Exhaust Gas Recirculation Valve 2 Position Sensor - 0.47V
This is an example of normal operation. As flow through the EGR cooler changes, the pressure sensor value should
change as well. If the pressure sensor never changes while under different driving situations, verify the connector is
pinned out correctly as per SI, and that there aren’t circuit issues between the EGR differential pressure sensor and
the ECM. Also verify the hoses to the sensor are not pinched, twisted, or restricted.
Page 4 February, 2025 Bulletin No.: 25-NA-032
Wiggle the EGR differential sensor connector to see if the GDS read value changes. If the reading drops out or
notably changes while wiggling the connector, suspect there is an issue with the terminals in the connector, or
possibly in the sensor itself.

1. Estimated Nitrogen Oxides Concentration - 133.9 ppm
2. NOx Sensor 1 NOx Concentration - 321.3 ppm
3. Engine Load - 57.3%
4. Nitrogen Oxides Concentration Delta -187.4 ppm
Next, during a period of consistent engine load driving, 1-2 minutes, if the actual NOx 1 value is 100-250 ppm above
the Estimated Nitrogen Oxide Concentration value, there may be an issue with a restricted EGR cooler.

- Internal EGR Cooler Restriction
Sometimes the restriction will be evident when inspecting the EGR cooler.

Additionally, we have found that if the engine ingests anything that could be used as fuel while the code is running,
you can set this code. One example is if the vehicle suffers from oil consumption. Much like the L5P diesel, some
oil in the intercooler system is expected. Here is an example of a CAC that has a normal amount of oil in the outlet.
There may be a little condensation also, which can be normal depending on ambient conditions and vehicle usage. If
there is a lot of condensation/fluid in the CAC, make sure that the secondary coolant system bottle is not low. A
charge air cooler leaking coolant into the engine could cause this code to set.

GM bulletins are intended for use by professional technicians, NOT a "do-it-yourselfer" . They are written to inform these
technicians of conditions that may occur on some vehicles, or to provide information that could assist in the proper
service of a vehicle. Properly trained technicians have the equipment, tools, safety instructions, and know-how to do a job
properly and safely. If a condition is described, DO NOT assume that the bulletin applies to your vehicle, or that your
vehicle will have that condition. See your GM dealer for information on whether your vehicle may beneﬁt from the
information.

Looking into the cooler, next to the fins, this photo shows oil puddling in the CAC outlet. This much oil in the
induction could cause this code to set.
If this condition is noted, while monitoring the EGR Differential pressure sensor data, see if the sensor reading
changes with different engine loads, EGR 2 positions and Exhaust back pressure valve positions. The EGR differ-
ential pressure sensor value is part of how the ECM calculates the Estimated Nitrogen Oxide Concentration engine
output level.
