Remedy
C300, CLE300, E350, GLC300 and GLE350
-Check engine control unit N3/10 for software update.
-Proceed with software update if new software version 2549032303, 2549032403, 2549032503 or 2549032603 are
found.
-Clear faults and check for any symptoms on road test
early 2024 GLE350
Check if symptom can be reproduced during normal drive cycle.
-If reproducible, diagnose the cause of low pressure in fuel system.
-If not reproducible, drain and refill fuel tank with top tier premium gasoline. Clear faults and check vehicle operation.
