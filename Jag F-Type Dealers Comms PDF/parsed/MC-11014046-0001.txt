Condition / Concern
Some customers / technicians may comment that several fasteners, located on either side
of the hood latch, appear to be loose.  
These two fasteners can be seen in the two photos below . 
The ﬁrst photo shows both fasteners as a point of reference in relation to the hood latch. 
The second photo is a close-up of these fasteners to clearly show the gap that exists
between the head of the fastener and the plastic trim panel underneath.    

Customers ma y request, or technicians may tak e it upon themselves, to tighten these two
fasteners under the hood until they are fully seated. 
They ma y believe that they were mistak enly left loose during assembly of the vehicle.
Recommendations / Instructions
IMPOR TANT: Do NOT tighten, or otherwise move these two fasteners. 
These fasteners are part of the front fascia support brack et. 
They have a preset gap by design, and they have Loctite applied to the threads of the
fastener so that this preset gap does not change.
This component actually comes into the assembly plant preadjusted. 
The plant does not adjust these fasteners when they install the assembly in the car . 
These two screws are adjustable to allow for hood to fascia alignment, but they should
only be adjusted if the fascia is too high or too low in reference to the hood.
When these fasteners are adjusted, the vertical clearance of the front fascia to hood gap
will be changed.
