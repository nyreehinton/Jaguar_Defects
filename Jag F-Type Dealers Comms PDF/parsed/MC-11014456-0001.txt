Correction 1.  T o correct this concern enable the inner tailgate.  The following information
is from the owners manual:
The inner tailgate ma y be equipped with an enable/disable feature to prevent the inner

the inner tailgate.
To disable the inner tailgate from opening: ensure that the remote k ey is within 1 meter (3
ft) of the rear bumper and then hold the upper touch pad on the tailgate handle for three
seconds.
The tail lamps will ﬂash to alert you that the inner gate has been disabled.
The inner and outer tailgate can still be operated lik e a traditional tailgate, but the inner
gate will not be able to be opened alone.
To enable the inner tailgate function, hold the upper touch pad on the handle for 3 seconds
until the tail lamps ﬂash.
The inner tailgate can now be opened separately from the outer tailgate.

2022 Sierra 1500 New RPO J22.  T o correct this concern reprogram the BCM with the latest
