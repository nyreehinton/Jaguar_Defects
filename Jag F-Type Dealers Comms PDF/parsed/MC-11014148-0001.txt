The HLCM might have set a fail-safe flag. There is a script in VIDA where you can see if the fail-safe 
flag is active and recover the fail-safe flag if it´s active. 
Follow the steps in PDF “TJ_37206_1” to check and recover the fail-safe flag. If the fail-safe flag is still 
active after step 8 in the PDF “TJ_37206_1” the HLCM needs to be replaced.
