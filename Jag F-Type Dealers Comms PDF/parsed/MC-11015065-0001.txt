3.6L PSU Long Block
Misfire DTC codes and/or rough idle and/or valvetrain noise. These conditions may be
related to worn intake camshaft high lift lobe(s), and intake rocker arm(s) high lift slider . High
mileage failure (10,000-60,000 miles). 1. Remove the valve cover(s) per the released
service procedures. The use of a stethoscope or DTC specific cylinder misfire codes can
help to locate the condition to the left or right bank. 2. Once it has been visually confirmed
that there is wear on the high lift intake lobe(s) & rocker arm(s) slider , there is a special
service kit for this type of repair which should be used, instead of replacing the complete
engine/long block. This kit contains the parts required for the repair (intake cam, rocker
arms, sealer and gaskets). Once it is confirmed that the repair will be done using the
camshaft/Rocker arms kit, it is also important to confirm that the vehicle being repaired has
the latest calibration/software update for oil pump operation mode (high pressure mode)
during engine start up. RU, VF , WL & WD vehicles already include the latest oil pump mode
in all 25MY  and beyond. 24MY  service releases are also available. JL  & JT  were updated as
a running change in 24MY  and beyond (08/15/24 & 08/19/24 respectively). 24MY  service
releases available. DT  was updated starting 25MY  and beyond. If the vehicle to be repaired
is a 24MY  vehicle with a service release available, please follow the released service
procedures to update to the corresponding calibration/software update.
