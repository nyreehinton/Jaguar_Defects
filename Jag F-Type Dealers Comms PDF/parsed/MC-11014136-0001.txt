 HIGH PRESSURE FUEL PUMP REPLACEMENT  
(WARRANTY EXTENSION Z05G ) 
 
Description:  Certain 2019 -2023MY G70 (IK) vehicles are equipped with high pressure fuel pump 
(HPFP) assemblies that have fuel control valves (FCV) that could allow excess fuel to enter the fuel 
pump due to gradual wear of the FCV plunger. An air/fuel mixture that runs too “rich” may result in a 
reduction or loss of motive power at low speeds. The vehicle will also have Diagnostic Trouble Code 
(DTC) P0088.  
 
Genesis is extending warranty coverage for the HPFP under this condition to 15 years or 150,000 miles 
from the date of original retail delivery or date of first use (whichever occurs first) and is valid for original 
and subsequent owners.  
 
Follow the service procedure in this TSB to replace the HPFP.

Service Procedure:  
 
 
 
1. Using a GDS scan tool, inspect to confirm if vehicle has DTC P0088 (or P008800 ).  
• If vehicle has DTC P0088/P008800 , then follow the next step s below  to replace the high 
pressure fuel pump.   
• If vehicles does NOT  have DTC P0088/P008800 , this TSB does NOT  apply.  Continue 
with normal diagnosis.  
 
 
 
2. Verify that Recall 023G  has been completed previously.  
• Verify ECU Update Event #114 0 has been completed.  
• If Recall 023G  has NOT  been performed, this TSB does NOT  apply.  
o Follow the service procedure listed in Recall 023G  (TSB 24-01-076G  or latest
