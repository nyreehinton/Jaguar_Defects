Urgent
Subject:Update - Delivery Stop: Integrated Fuel Module
The Remedy is now available for vehicles affected by Delivery Stop: Integrated Fuel Module (B16 01
25) and the bulletin has been updated on TIS.
Due to system processing times, the “Remedy Available” Green Check may not display in ROSS
systems yet; this will update in the coming days.  However, the Remedy is available for all VINs and
can be performed.
If an RDR override is necessary due to the system displaying the Stop, you can enter the RO
number and date the programming was performed.
If vehicles have any other open Campaigns, they must be completed prior to delivery to the
customer.
Sincerely,
Technical Service
