Units : SR-3 Single Temperature T -90 
Description : SR-3.1 Single Temperature Base Controller Software Revision D100 was 
released in the 4th Quarter of 2024. This software is available from Thermo 
King® e-Tech  Library.  
Summary:  SR-3 base controller boards will be replaced by SR -3.1 base controller boards 
due to obsolete components on the base controller. Form, fit, and function are the same as SR -3. SR -3.1 requires new software (D100) and is not backwards 
compatible  with SR- 3. 
Important:  D100 software can only be used on SR -3.1 base controller boards.  D100 will not 
allow you to flash on a SR-3.0 board.  
Base Controller Color Identification:  
The Base Controller can easily be identified by the color of the board.  
• SR-3 Base Controller (2024 and earlier) are colored Blue.  
• SR-3.1 Base Controller (2024 and later) are colored Green.

IMPORTANT: SR-3.1 Base Controller software D100 and HMI Control Panel software 75C8 and 
above are both required for full feature availability.  
IMPORTANT: Unless otherwise noted, software upgrades made to units with previous software 
revisions are not covered by a warranty labor allowance. This upgrade is made at the discretion 
of dealers and with the agreement of the unit owner or operator.  
NOTE:  If an SR -3.1 controller with D100 is replacing an SR -2 controller, the SR -2 HMI (4 MB) 
must be flashloaded with HMI software 68C4 to be compatible with D100.  
WinTrac® and OptiSet® Plus Software Requirements:  
SR-3 truck applications with D100 require WinTrac 6.12 or later.  
Availability:  
Base Controller software D100 and HMI Control Panel software 75C8 are available in e-Tech 
Library.  
• SR-3 Base Controller D 100 Software - The file name for the *.ZIP file containing both the 
traditional .mXX and .cXX files and the *.FLA file is Micro Code D 100 Update for the SR -

When Base Controller and/or HMI Control Panel flashload files are downloaded from the Thermo 
King e-Tech  Library, they are downloaded as a *.ZIP file. When flashload files for these SR -3.1 
applications are unzipped, there will be three files.  
• The traditional *.mXX and *.cXX files will be unzipped. These two files are for use when flashloading the SR -3 unit in the traditional manner by using a data cable to connect the 
SR-3 unit to a computer equipped with WinTrac.

 NOTE:  Both the *.mXX and *.cXX files must be present in order to perform a flashload 
using a data cable, even though only one of them is shown by WinTrac.  
• A *.FLA file will also be unzipped. This file is for use when flashloading a unit using a 
WinTrac configured USB Flash Drive. Refer to TT611 - FLA Files for SR- 3 Single 
Temperature Units  for more information about using FLA files.  
NOTE:  If the USB Flash Drive is used, the appropriate *.fla file must be placed on a 
WinTrac  configured Flash Drive. The *.fla files must be placed in the appropriate folders 
on the Flash Drive.  
Flashloading:  
For additional information on flashloading software using a computer, WinTrac, and a data cable, 
refer to Service Procedure A46A  and Service Procedure A46B  of the SR -3 Truck Single Temp 
Diagnostic Manual (TK 55208).  
NOTE: T-90 units do not have a 4 pin to 5 pin Deutsch connector included. To connect to the 
board, use a 4 pin to 5 pin Deutsch cable such as aftermarket PN 415484.
