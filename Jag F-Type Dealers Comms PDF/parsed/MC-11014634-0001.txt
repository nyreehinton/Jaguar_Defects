Correction
If you encounter a vehicle setting DTC P04FB in temperatures below freezing that has
failed current or history complete the published SI diagnostics for the DTC. 
If unable to establish a root cause. Remove the PCV/Crankcase Pressure Sensor and hose
assembly and inspect for presence of frozen moisture/condensation in the Crankcase
Pressure sensor and hose assembly .
If frozen moisture is present, replacement of the Crankcase Pressure Sensor will not be
necessary . Please allow the Crankcase pressure sensor and hose assembly to thaw out and
the moisture to drain completely . Use a combination of light compressed air and a shop
towel to remove any residual condensation/moisture.
Note: If the ambient air temperatures have not been below freezing but moisture is still
present in the Crankcase pressure sensor . Remove the moisture using a combination of
light compressed air and a shop towel.
Once completed clear any remaining DTC's using GDS and evaluate.
