Subaru Service Bulletins are intended for use by professional technicians ONLY . They 
are written to inform those technicians of conditions that may occur in some vehicles, 
or to provide information that could assist in the proper servicing of the vehicle. Properly 
trained technicians have the equipment, tools, safety instructions, and know-how to 
do the job correctly and safely. If a condition is described, DO NOT assume that this 
Service Bulletin applies to your vehicle, or that your vehicle will have that condition.Subaru of America, Inc. is  
ISO 14001 Compliant
ISO 14001 is the international standard for

 SUBJECT: Reprogramming Files for DTCs P0890 & P0700
INTRODUCTION:
This bulletin announces availability of reprograming files for the Engine Control Module (ECM) 
developed to address the following Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTC):
• P0890: TCM Power Relay Sense Circuit Low
• P0700: Transmission Control System (MIL Resquest)
When shutting the engine off after a short distance drive in ambient temperatures of 32°f (0°C) or 
below, moisture may develop inside the starter relay and cause the internal contacts to stick or freeze 
resulting in a no crank / no start condition. The new software cycles the relay contacts periodically 
to prevent any sticking or freezing.  If this situation is reported by a customer and/or DTC P0890 & 
P0700 is stored in the ECM fault memory, perform the reprogramming procedure outlined below.
PRODUCTION CHANGE INFORMATION:
The reprogramming files have been incorporated into vehicle production as per the table below .

SERVICE PROCEDURE / INFORMATION:
REMINDER: Customer satisfaction and retention starts with performing quality repairs. 
• Reprogram the ECM following the normal SSM5-R procedure.
• Detailed information regarding the SSM5-R reprograming procedures can be found in TSB 
14-28-21R.
REMINDER:  Customer satisfaction and retention starts with performing quality repairs.
Subaru of America, Inc. (SOA) highly recommends utilizing either the Subaru Midtronics DCA-
8000 Dynamic Diagnostic Charging System or the Subaru Midtronics GR8-1100 Diagnostic Battery 
Charger to the vehicle and utilizing the Power Supply Mode feature anytime a vehicle control module 
is being reprogrammed. Once the Midtronics charger is connected to the vehicle, if the battery is fully 
charged, it takes less than three (3) minutes to boot-up the charger, select the Power Supply Mode, 
and have the battery voltage stabilized and ready for reprogramming.
NOTES:
• For instructions on using the Power Supply Mode, reference the applicable User Manual for 
the Midtronics DCA-8000 Dynamic Diagnostic Charging System and the Midtronics GR8-
1100 Diagnostic Battery Charger on STIS
• Confirm all electrical loads such as lights, audio, HV AC, seat heaters, and rear defroster are all 
switched OFF before setting up the charger for Power Supply Mode.
• Select the correct battery type (Enhanced Flooded, Flooded, Gel, AGM or AGM Spiral).

Continued...• Input the CCA which matches the vehicle’s battery. NOTE: OE and replacement batteries have 
different CCA ratings. Always confirm the battery’s CCA rating before proceeding.
• If using a DCA-8000 Dynamic Diagnostic Charging System, set the power supply voltage to 
13.5 V olts.
• DO NOT connect the DST-i or DST-010 until the Power Supply mode function has completed 
its battery test mode and the Charging V oltage has dropped to and shows a steady 13.5 V olts on 
the display.
• Once Power Supply Mode reaches a steady 13.5 V olts, connect the DST-i or DST-010 to the 
OBD connector and proceed with initiating the normal SSM5-R reprogramming process.
• Amperage will fluctuate based upon the vehicle’s demand for power. NOTE: If the voltage 
rises beyond 14 V olts while programming is in process, the procedure will abort. This can 
indicate a need to test or charge the vehicle battery before any further attempt at programming 
is made.
• ALWAYS set the power supply voltage to 13.5 V olts when using Power Supply Mode. NEVER 
turn the ignition switch on when charging at voltages 15 V olts or higher.
REMINDER: If the DCA-8000 or GR8-1100 indicates the vehicle’s battery must be charged, charge 
the battery fully before proceeding to reprogram the vehicle while using the Power Supply Mode.
NOTE: Control module failures resulting from battery discharge during reprogramming are not a 
matter for warranty. Should any DTCs reset after the reprogramming update is performed, diagnose 
per the procedure outlined in the applicable Service Manual.
WARRANTY / CLAIM INFORMATION:
For vehicles within the Federal Emission Extended Defect Warranty period, or covered by and active 
Subaru Added Security Classic or Gold plan this repair may be submitted using the following claim 
information:  
Labor Description Labor Operation # Fail Code Labor Time
MFI OBDII ECM Reprogramming A450-086 UPG-48 0.4
IMPORTANT: Always note the original Calibration Identification number (CID) / ROMID the 
vehicle came in with on the repair order before reprogramming and, make sure to list the NEW CID / 
ROMID for any newly installed programming (as confirmed from the actual control module AFTER 
installation). The NEW CID / ROMID MUST also be noted on the repair order as this information is 
required for entry in the Miscellaneous Detail field during claim submission. These numbers can be 
read using SSM5-R.

NOTE: The pfc file listings provided in this bulletin are the latest available at the time of publishing. 
Updates are often released thereafter without revision to the original bulletin. For this reason, it is 
critical to always have the latest version of Select Monitor software installed on your system. You 
can confirm if a later version is available by entering the CID listed in this bulletin into SSM5-R. If a 
newer CID is shown as available in SSM5-R, reprogram using that file.
IMPORTANT REMINDERS:
• SOA strongly discourages the printing and/or local storage of service information as previously 
released information and electronic publications may be updated at any time.
• Always check for any open recalls or campaigns anytime a vehicle is in for servicing.
• Always refer to STIS for the latest service information before performing any repairs.
