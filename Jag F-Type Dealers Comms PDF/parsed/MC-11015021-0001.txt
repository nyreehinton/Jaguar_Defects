Discussion : Gaps in the defroster grille generally fall into 2 groups. Center and edge 
gaps. If a customer has a concern with the grille fitment, see the below for some tips 
on how to resolve the gapping condition.  
 
Tool s: Plastic or fiber trim stick.  
 
1.) Inspect the defroster grille for any gaps along the edges.  
2.) If gaps found on the edges near the a -pillar go to step 3. If gaps are found in the 
center of the defroster grille go to step 8.  
3.) Using the trim stick remove the defroster grille from the vehicle.  
4.) Inspect the clip slots near the suspect location for any excessive flash or glass 
material . See Fig 4 below.  
5.) If excessive material is found, remove the excessive material  by carefully using a 
hobby knife.  
6.) Reinstall defroster grille and validate the clip now fully seats and there is no visible 
gap. 
7.) If gaps are present in the center of the defroster grille proceed to step 8.  
8.) Using the trim stick remove the defroster grille from the vehicle.  
9.) Inspect the defroster grille for broken or bent clips. Replace the defroster grille if 
damage is present. If no damage is present proceed to step 10.  
10.) Reinstall the defroster grille by starting with the center 4 -way locator. This clip is in 
the center left of the defroster grille.  (Fig 5) 
11.) Once the 4 -way is installed secure the clips starting at the center and working your 
way to the ends for both the left and right side.  
12.) Inspect the defroster grille for any gaps. If there are no gaps present, repair is 
complete.  
13.) If the gap is still present, remove the grille, use MOPAR 68620879AA Velcro  or a 
commercially available double -sided  tape such as 3M 5952 VHB tape  applied in the 
spot where the grille is lifting or has a gap.  Clean both surfaces with isopropyl alcohol 
to remove any oils or surface contami nates prior to adhesive  applicat ion. See Fig 3 . 
14.) If gaps are still present replace the defroster grille.
