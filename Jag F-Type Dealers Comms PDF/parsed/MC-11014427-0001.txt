Some 2020-2022 F-Super Duty vehicles equipped with a 6.7L engine may exhibit an illuminated malfunction
indicator lamp (MIL) with diagnostic trouble code (DTC) U3012 only stored in the powertrain control module
(PCM). This may be due to the software in the PCM and/or a concern with the Telematics Control Unit (TCU)
Module. To correct this condition, verify the battery state of charge (SOC) using a Ford Diagnostic and Repair
System (FDRS) scan tool by navigating to Toolbox tab > Datalogger > BCM and viewing the BATT_SOC
parameter identification (PID). If the SOC is less than 70%, refer to Workshop Manual (WSM) Section 414-01
to diagnose the battery. If the BATT_SOC PID reads 70% or higher, check OASIS and perform any applicable
TSBs directing to update the PCM software. If no OASIS message is present and/or the PCM is at the latest
level, replace the TCU with latest level part. Refer to WSM, Section 415-00. For claiming, use causal part
14G229 and applicable labor operations in Section 10 of the Service Labor Time Standards (SLTS) Manual.
