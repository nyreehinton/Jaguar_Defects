Procedure  
 
1. Perform the Proterra approved Lockout/Tagout procedure for safety. Refer to the Proterra 
Catalyst LOTO Safety Guide if you are unsure of the proper procedure.  
 
2. Using Wheel Lifts raise the bus. Use four Jack Stands to support the bus after it is lifted.  
  
  
3. Using a 13mm Ratchet/Socket and a 13mm Combination Wrench, remove the front bumper.  
  
4. Place a Catch Pan underneath the power steering reservoir drain plug.  
 
5. Some fittings in this procedure are National Pipe Thread (NPT) fittings. All NPT fittings require Loctite 567 on the tape red threads. Failure to apply Loctite 567 will cause leaks.
