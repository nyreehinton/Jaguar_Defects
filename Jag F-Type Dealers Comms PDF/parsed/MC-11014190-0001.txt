has been enhanced to help identify if a replacement ECU requires an ECU Security Key . Follow the 
procedures in this bulletin to write the ECU Security Key  to the replacement ECU.

Confirm ECU Security Key Writing Requirement  
After ECU replacement, it is important to confirm if ECU Security Key  writing is necessary. There 
are two methods available to confirm if the ECU Security Key  writing function is required within 
the GTS+  software : performing a Health Check and using the ECU Security Key button . 
 
Health Check  
Performing a Health Check will confirm if ECU Security Key  writing is needed.  The GTS+  Health  
Check Results screen has been enhanced to include an ECU Security Key  indicator. The ECU  
Security Key  indicator will display “Necessary” when an ECU Security Key  needs to be written  
and “-” when ECU Security Key  writing is  NOT  required .
