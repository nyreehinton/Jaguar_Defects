Customer Satisfaction Program 23P22 – Supplement #1 
New!  REPLACED FSA PARTS INSPECTION AND SIGN OFF  (continued) 
• All parts replaced as part of an FSA repair should be returned to the parts department 
following the Warranty Parts Retention and Return Policies.  
• Inspect the replaced parts to verify the FSA repair was completed. 
• If the FSA repair is found to be complete, the designated employee signs the repair order line 
or parts return stamp area (electronic or hand signed) for the FSA repair indicating the parts were inspected and validated to have been replaced.  
• After the parts have been inspected, they should be handled based on the guidance in the parts status report in the Online Warranty System (Hold, Return, CORE, Scrap, etc.). Please 
visit FMCDEALER > PARTS & SERVICE > WARRANTY ADMINISTRATION & WARRANTY 
PARTS RETURN for the latest Immediate Scrap List
 information.  
• This process is subject to review during warranty audits for FSA repairs with a repair order open date of March 1
st, 2021, or later. Any eligible FSA claims requiring parts replacement 
found not to have been inspected and signed off during a warranty audit will be subject to chargeback and consideration for enrollment into the Dealer Incomplete Recall Repair Process.  
Note : Other approvals (electronic or handwritten) for add-on repair lines, dealer -owned vehicle 
repairs, and repeat repairs do not qualify as FSA parts inspection approvals. The post-repair  FSA 
parts inspection process (electronic or handwritten) is independent of other warranty approval 
requirements. The approval by the designated employee implies that the FSA parts were found to be replaced and must be able to be identified on the Repair Order. If multiple FSAs require approval on a 
single Repair Order, each applicable occurrence will require individual post -repair  approval by the 
designated employee.
