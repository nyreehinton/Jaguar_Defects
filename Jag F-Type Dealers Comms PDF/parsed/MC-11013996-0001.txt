cy Stop Assist not active/Active Lane Keep Assist
Topic number LI46.10-P-078012
Version 3
Function group 46.10 - Steering wheel, jacket tube, steering shaft, stee-
ring lock
Date 2/3/25
Validity Vehicles with capacitive steering wheel with code 266
and manufacturing date as from 2020
Reason for change Remedy Adjusted
Complaint
Hand detection system not operating correctly / vehicles with code 266
Fault message in instrument cluster:
"Active Emergency Stop Assist not available"
"Active Lane Keeping Assist not available"
Cause
Possible causes: the hand detection mat, the hand detection control unit, the contacts and the steering wheel har-
ness.
Remedy
Test Procedure:
Perform an initial quick test with freeze frame data. Save the N179 - Hand detection system (HE) and N62/4 - Driver
assistance system (SG-FAS) control unit logs. Note the fault frequency of fault codes set.
Delete the N179 and N62/4 fault memory.
Using both hands, "scan" the steering wheel all the way round, including the chrome molding at 6 o'clock (see Picture
1).
Read out fault memory and follow steps below for any faults set.
Remedy:
Vehicles with control unit N179 - Hand detection system (HE):
B1E7614 :
Check contacts and wiring harness in steering wheel by carrying out a visual check for damage, pinched areas, loo-
se connections, etc. (examples in Figs. 2 and 3); If no damage is noted replace the N135 - Steering wheel electronics
(LRE) and reassess. If fault code returns replace the steering wheel.
B1E7713 :
Please check the wires and connections in the steering wheel. Afterwards, please check whether the complaint is
caused by over torqued screws on steering wheel trim pieces. To do this, please loosen the screws slightly and re-
evaluate the situation. (Picture 4).
P164456 :
Perform SCN coding.
P1CA000 :
Perform an initial start-up on the N179 hand detection control unit.

Faults in N62/4 - Driver assistance system (SG-FAS) control unit with U186B29, U0429E0, U042941, U042929,
U042902, U0429E1:
If no fault is stored in the N179 control unit:
Scan steering wheel as indicated in the test procedure and check whether the fault is reproducible.
If no fault code is stored in the hand detection control unit, the fault codes in the driver assistance systems control unit
are precautionary messages.
Software for the N62/4 - Driver assistance system (SG-FAS) is now available for Star 3 vehicles only.
Fault in IDC223 control unit:
U186B29:
Delete fault memory and flash the new IDC (N62/4) software A223 902 75 37. If the software update is not available,
or the problem persists, create a TIPS case.
Fault in IDC213 control unit:
U0429E0, U042941, U042929, U042902, U0429E1:
If no fault is stored in the HOSWD control unit then scan the steering wheel and check whether the fault is reproducib-
le.
If reproducible: Create a TIPS case, adding the note "reproducible".
If no fault code is stored in the hand detection control unit, the fault codes in the driver assistance systems control unit
are precautionary messages. New coding parameters (SCN) will be available in Q2/2025 for the HOSWD control unit.
