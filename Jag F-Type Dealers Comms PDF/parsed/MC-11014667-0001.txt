CHECK ENGINE LIGHT  ON FROM MISSING MESSAGE DTC IN IHKA2025-02-28
This Service Information Bulletin (Revision 2) replaces SI B64 03 25 dated February 26, 2025.
 
What’ s New :
Model: Production range
Procedure: Currently there is an Execution Break and the backup I-Level needs to be used S18A-24-
11-570. This backup I-Level has the improved software needed for the IHKA  control module.

MODEL
E-Series Model Description Production Date Engine 
G05 X5 xDrive50e Vehicles produced from July 2024 to March 2025 XB1N
 
SITUA TION
Check Engine Light is illuminated, check control message indicates “bring in for service”. The faults
themselves and the Malfunction Indicator Lamp (MIL) have no functional ef fect on the vehicle.
 
There are multiple missing message fault codes (DTC) stored in the integrated automatic heating/air
conditioning system (IHKA) control unit. 
 
These faults may include: 
E71458 - AC-LIN: Message EKMV20
E71459 - AC-LIN: Message EDH.  
CAUSE
Software in the IHKA  control module.
 
On-Board Diagnostics (OBD) requires monitoring of the multiple battery cooling control modules
communication to the engine control module. If communication is interrupted, a Check Engine Light can
result. 
 
CORRECTION
Program/encode the IHKA  control module. 
 
The missing message faults will no longer appear , unless relevant , once the vehicle is updated with ISTA
4.52.15 to I-Level 25-03-530 (Backup I-level S18A-24-1 1-570)
 
PROCEDURE
Determine the vehicle’ s current integration level (I-level) by either using AIR or the Key Reader ISP A
Next/A WP (Aftersales W orkplace) applications.
 
1.Is the current vehicle I-level lower than:
Model Target integration level
G05 S18A-25-03-530
Or
S18A-24-1 1-570
            YES: Proceed to Step 2 
            NO: Further diagnosis with IST A is needed
 
2. Program the vehicle using IST A 4.52.15 or higher (released February 21, 2025).

Model Target integration level
G05 S18A-25-03-530
Or
S18A-24-1 1-570
 
Special Note: Currently there is an Execution Break and the backup I-Level needs to be used S18A-
24-11-570. 
 
This backup I-Level has the improved software needed for the IHKA.
 
After the programming has been fully completed, check the functionality of the system.
Note: IST A will automatically reprogram and code all programmable control modules that do not have the
latest software. 
 
Always connect a BMW -approved battery charger/power supply ( SI B04 23 10 ). 
 
For information on programming and coding with IST A, refer to TIS / Technical Documentation / Diagnostics
and Programming / Programming Documentation.
 
PARTS INFORMA TION
Part exchange of the IHKA  control unit does not provide a solution.
 
CLAIM INFORMA TION
Vehicle Programming and Encoding
 
During this workshop visit, the af fected vehicle may also show one or more programming and encoding Technical Campaign
repairs open, the programming and encoding procedure may only be invoiced one time.
 
Select one of these open T echnical Campaigns instead to perform and submit for updating the vehicle to the
required I-level, or higher when applicable (Includes labor operation codes 00 00 006/556, 61 21 528 and 61 00 730). 
 
Please be sure to also perform any additional before and/or after work (including attaching labels) as required by
the open campaigns on the vehicle. Close any other open programming and encoding Campaign repairs as outlined
in the corresponding Service Information Bulletin.
 
Only when the above does not apply , the BMW software solution is then covered under the terms of the
BMW New V ehicle Limited W arranty for Passenger Cars and Light Trucks, or the BMW Certified Pre-Owned
Program as described below .

If you are using a Main labor code for another repair , use the Plus code labor operation 00 00 556 instead of
00 00 006, or exclude them (including 61 21 528) when the V ehicle Test is included in another repair .
 
Work time labor operation codes 61 00 006 and 00 58 500 are not considered Main labor operations.
 
Vehicle Programming and Encoding – Additional W ork (RO and Claim Comments Required)
 
This procedure automatically reprograms and encodes any vehicle control modules that do not have the latest software I-
level. 
 
If one or more control modules fail during the reprogramming procedure, claim the required consequential
repair work procedures to address this issue (including performing the IRAP  Control Unit Recovery first as
required, refer to the SIB in AIR) under the Repair Code in this bulletin together with the corresponding labor
operation codes and their flat rate unit (FRU) allowance(s), including the diagnosis* that applies.
 
Please explain the additional work procedures that were performed (The why and the what) on the repair order and in the
claim comments.
 
For covered repairs that address control module failures that occurred prior to performing this
reprogramming procedure, claim this work with the appliable Repair Code listed in AIR together with the
corresponding labor operation codes and their flat rate unit (FRU) allowance(s), including the diagnosis* that
applies.
 
(*) Based on which one applies to your center , please refer to SI B01 01 20  or B01 07 20  for the applicable procedure for
documenting, claiming, and explaining, on the RO and in the claim comments, your diagnosis work time (WT), job/repair
work time (WT), and the vehicle repairs your center performed, unless otherwise required by State law .
 
Other Repairs
 
If other eligible and covered work is performed because of performing the IST A diagnostics, related test
plans, and/or other approved diagnosis procedures, claim this work with the applicable Repair Code listed in
AIR together with the corresponding labor operation codes and their flat rate unit (FRU) allowance(s),
including the diagnosis* that applies.
 
BMW Group’ s AIR Application Resource for Flat Rate Labor Operation Codes
 
To obtain the corresponding flat rate unit (FRU) allowance information from the BMW Group AIR application
resource, start by entering the the Chassis Number (last seven (7) characters of the VIN), and click on the
“Search” icon. If the “V ehicle Selection” window displays two or more model possible vehicle choices, select
the applicable Model, or enter the full VIN (17 characters) instead to proceed.  Click on the “Flat Rate Units”
button and enter a flat rate labor operation code number “without spaces” in the field to the right, click on the
“Search” icon to display the corresponding listing of “Flat rate unit group details” that are available and their
corresponding FRU allowances.
