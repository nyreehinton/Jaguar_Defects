IMPORTANT SAFETY RECALL NOTICE  
 
Date: October 23, 2024  
Re: Newmar Corporation – Motor Vehicle Recall Notification  
 
Subject:  TC Recall Campaign No.:  2024-619, Newmar Campaign No.   615 RSB 
This notice is sent to you as a Newmar Dealer in accordance with the requirements of the Canada Motor Vehicle 
Safety Act.   Newmar Corporation has decided that a non-compliance, which relates to motor vehicle safety, exists 
in specific Newmar recreational vehicles.   
Each vehicle, which is subject to a recall campaign of this type, must be satisfactorily repaired within a reasonable 
time after the owner has tendered it for repair.  A failure to adequately repair within 60 days after tender of a 
vehicle is prima facie evidence of failure to repair within a reasonable time. To avoid providing these problematic 
solutions, every effort must be made to promptly schedule an appointment with each owner and to repair their 
vehicle as soon as possible.  Vehicle owners are being notified of this recall. If the condition is not remedied within 
a reasonable time, they are instructed to contact Transport Canada. 
REASON FOR THIS RECALL 
Newmar Corporation has decided that a non-compliance, which relates to motor vehicle safety, exists in specific 
motorhomes built on Ford Motor Company F53/F59 Chassis. This recall is the result of information provided to 
Newmar by Ford Motor Company, NHSTA recall #24V-275, Manufacture Recall No. 24C32.  
Issue:  
On a small number of motorhomes, a software problem could cause the transmission control positions and gear 
selection not to display properly in the instrument panel cluster. 
 
Safety Risk:  
A transmission gear position indicator that doesn't display properly could increase the risk of a crash.   
 
Corrective Actions:  
Newmar will notify owners by mail and advise you to take your motorhome to a Ford dealership to update the 
instrument panel cluster software.  This will be done at no charge to the customer. 
 
The vehicle models involved in this recall are: 
     2024-2025 Bay Star Class A motorhomes. 
 
The motorhomes require immediate service.  Continued use poses a potential safety hazard. 
DEALER CAMPAIGN RESPONSIBILITY 
Dealers are to provide to all customers/owner vehicles the service of completing this campaign at no charge to 
the customer/owner regardless of vehicle age, vehicle mileage, or ownership at the time of repair.
