Time Recording Waiver for Safety  Recall  10X5  
Safety  Recall 10X5  requires Dealers to remove the engine cover  on certain 2024-2025 Atlas and Atlas Cross Sport 
vehicles. Per section 2.4.2.1.2 Actual Clocked Time (A -Time) and Diagnosis Time  within the Volkswagen Warranty Policies 
and Procedures Manual , Dealers must support all A-Time claimed within SAGA  with proper punch times .  
As a result, Volkswagen Warranty is waiving the requirement for time punching for technicians on all 10X5  Safety Recall  
claims. All other standard documentation is still required.
