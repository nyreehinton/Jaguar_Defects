DASHCAM  Module 1 Internal Electronic Failure and/or U115C -00 Lost Communication With ETM.     
 
Discussion : If these DTCs are observed, clear the DTCs, perform a module hard reset  found 
under Guided Diagnostics tab – ECU Reset , wait 20 seconds and then allow a sleep cycle  and then 
perform a proxi alignment if needed .  
Then v erify the DXR app has been added to the radio. If the app is present, validate that the 
DTCs do not return. If U115C -00 persists, open the DXR app and accept the disclaimer. If the app is 
not present  after the Application Over The Air (AOTA)  update , it may be delayed from heavy network 
traffic and or an extended sleep cycle to complete  the update .
