Case Number:   S2519000001  
 
 
Release Date:   February 2025  
 
 
Symptom/Vehicle Issue : Steering Drift And Or Pull.  
 
 
Customer Complaint/T echnician Observation:  Vehicle steering drifts or pulls while 
driving.  
 
 
Discussion : Many electric power steering ( EPS) units have been replaced and exhibit 
no issues when tested after the part was received back for analysis.  Prior to replacing 
any components for a drift or pull concern, verify the vehicle is in specification for 
alignment.  Then test drive to confirm condition is resolved.
