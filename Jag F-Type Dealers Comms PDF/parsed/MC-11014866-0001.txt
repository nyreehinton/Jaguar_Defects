Diagnosis and Testing. Is the coolant pump leaking?
(1). Yes - proceed to Step 2.
(2). No - this article does not apply. Continue with normal WSM diagnosis.
2. Add Motorcraft® Premium Cooling System Flush to the cooling system and top off with water as needed and allow
the engine to idle for 30 minutes.
3. Drain the cooling system and leave the radiator drain valve open. Refer to the WSM, Section 303-03A Engine
Cooling - 1.5L EcoBoost > Engine Cooling System Draining, Vacuum Filling and Bleeding.
4. Remove the air cleaner. Refer to WSM, Section 303-12A Intake Air Distribution and Filtering - 1.5L EcoBoost >
Removal and Installation > Air Cleaner.
5. Loosen the clamp and remove the air cleaner outlet pipe in Figure 1.
Figure 1
6. Release the clamps and disconnect the upper and lower radiator hoses from the radiator.
7. Flush the radiator for 2-3 minutes by inserting/connecting a freshwater hose or flush machine in the upper hose
port of the radiator.
8. Using compressed air regulated down to 20-30psi, blow compressed air through the upper hose connection of the
radiator for 1-2 minutes to remove any remaining water.
9. Remove the coolant pump. Refer to WSM, Section 303-03A Engine Cooling - 1.5L EcoBoost > Removal and
Installation > Coolant Pump.
(1). The water pump pulley bolts can be reused for this repair if there is no damage to the bolts identified. This
may differ from current WSM direction.
10. Release the clamp and disconnect the heater core return hose from the hose connection near location shown in
Figure 2.
Figure 2
11. Using a hose clamping tool, clamp off the coolant bypass hose in the location shown just blow the intake manifold

Figure 3
12. Using a hose clamping tool, clamp off the upper radiator hose. (Figure 4)
13. Flush the heater core and engine for 2-3 minutes by connecting a freshwater hose or flush machine to the heater

Figure 4
14. Using compressed air regulated down to 20-30psi, blow compressed air through the heater core return line for 1-
2 minutes to remove any remaining water.
15. Remove all the hose clamping tools. Connect the upper and lower radiator hoses and close the radiator drain
valve.
16. Install the new coolant pump. Refer to WSM, Section 303-03A Engine Cooling - 1.5L EcoBoost > Removal and
Installation > Coolant Pump.
