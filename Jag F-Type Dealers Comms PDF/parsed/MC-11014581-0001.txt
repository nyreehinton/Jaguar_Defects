Note: Corrosion alone will not cause this concern.  The quality of the actual welds is the
issue.  Dealership technicians are to inspect both the lower weld on the bottom of the res-
onator, as well as the upper weld on top of the resonator for signs of cracking.
- There is a tube located in the center of the resonator as shown in the graphic
above. This is NOT a drain tube for condensation inside the exhaust system. This pipe
is a structural component of the resonator that stiffens the upper and lower halves of
the assembly. The welds holding this tube in place may crack, resulting in a rattle
noise that can be heard by the owner of the vehicle.  This will be most noticeable
when starting the engine and/or applying the throttle. 
CorrectionInspect the lower weld on the bottom of the resonator, as well as the upper weld on top of
the resonator for signs of cracking. If the concern listed above has been found, replace
the rear portion of the exhaust system.
