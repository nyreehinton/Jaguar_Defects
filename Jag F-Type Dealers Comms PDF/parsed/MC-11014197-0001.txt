NOTE ( Guests  who live in the state of California )  
The state of California requires the completion of Safety Recalls / Service Campaigns on emission related parts prior to vehicle 
registration renewal. In addition, the State requires that every vehicle must pass an emission test (SMOG Check) every two year s 
and before it is sold. Without the completion of this FREE  Special Service Campaign , the California Air Res ources  Board (CARB) 
will not allow your vehicle to be registered. State of California Regulations require Lexus to provide the Department of Motor 
Vehicles with a record of all vehicles that have not had the Special Service Campaign completed.  
 
Your Lexus  dealer will provide you with a Vehicle Emissions Recall Proof of Correction Form after the campaign has been 
completed. Please ensure you retain this form, because the DMV may require that you supply proof that the campaign has been completed during your vehicle registration renewal process.
