Attention:
Important: Courtesy Transportation and Roadside Assistance are not part of or included in the coverage provided
by the New Vehicle Limited Warranty. Courtesy Transportation must be managed through the dealership, and
Roadside events managed through GM Roadside Assistance. Requests for customer reimbursement for Courtesy
Transportation and/or Roadside Assistance under the Courtesy Transportation and/or Roadside Assistance
Programs are considered on a case-by-case basis. GM reserves the right to modify or discontinue the Courtesy
Transportation and/or Roadside Assistance Programs at any time.
GM COURTESY TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM
Program Coverage and Eligibility
“Courtesy Transportation” is defined as any form of transportation permitted within the guidelines of the GM
Courtesy Transportation Program. This includes shuttle, reimbursement of fuel or for use of public transportation
(ride-hailing/carshare apps), and loaner vehicles (including loaners obtained through third-party rental agencies).
Courtesy Transportation can be made available for warranty repairs for all GM vehicle purchase/lease customers
and GM company-owned vehicle drivers within the Bumper-to-Bumper, Powertrain and/or Hybrid/EV specific (8 year/
100,000) and Federal Emissions coverage of the New Vehicle Limited Warranty (excluding Low Cab Forward MD
Trucks).
•Please refer to the vehicle’s Warranty and Owner Assistance Manual or the Applicable Warranties
section of Investigate Vehicle History (IVH) for vehicle-specific age/mileage warranty terms
• May be used in conjunction with repairs covered by a GM Certified Pre-Owned Warranty and used vehicles
purchased under the CarBravo program
Courtesy Transportation expenses are ineligible for reimbursement under the following circumstances:
• During repairs covered by the Corrosion Coverage or any non-Federal Emissions Warranty (e.g,. Select State,
PZEV or any California Emissions Warranty) outside of the Bumper-to-Bumper Coverage.
• During Policy repairs
• During non-warranty Service Agent provided services, such as customer pay
• During GM brand maintenance programs services
• During parts warranty repairs (ZPTI and ZPTC transaction types)
• Use of a loaner vehicle beyond completion of the warranty repair is the customer’s responsibility.
Page 2 February, 2025 Bulletin No.: 07-00-89-037V
• During services provided to vehicles in daily and long-term loaner service, demonstrator service, and dealer-
owned vehicles
• Dealer-owned vehicles not enrolled in the CTP program are not eligible for loaner reimbursement rates.
• Loaner (including third-party rental) vehicle insurance, fuel, taxes, levies, or any sort of vehicle licensing fee(s)
Other Related Policies
• To qualify for loaner reimbursement, loaner units must be no more than two model years old.
Note: CTP loaners are restricted to vehicles that are no more than two model years old as of the end of June every
year. For example, on June 30, 2025, only 2024 and 2025 model year CTP loaners qualify for GM Courtesy Trans-
portation reimbursement. See CTP guidelines for additional details.
• Loaners must be directly aligned to brand (and segment within the brand) which is being serviced (e.g.,
Chevrolet to Chevrolet). Every attempt should be made to provide the same make/model of vehicle that the
customer owns or leases. If this is not possible, upgrades to higher class GM brands should be utilized for
customer satisfaction.
• For Chevrolet Medium Duty Silverado 4500/5500/6500 vehicles, it may not be possible to provide customers a
like vehicle. Light duty loaner vehicles should be considered for alternate transportation.
• A maximum of three calendar days loaner is allowed when expenses incurred for obtaining a part locally are
also being applied to the job card.
• A maximum of five calendar days loaner is allowed when express parts shipping (CSO-3) charges are also
being applied to the job card. Please note, dealers are expected to utilize express shipping as needed when a
customer is in a loaner vehicle to minimize both vehicle downtime for the customer and Courtesy Transportation
expenses for GM.
• As of job cards dated Oct. 1, 2024, loaners of 7 or more calendar days must be routed for “GM Authorization” in
Global Warranty Management
• Vehicle loaner periods prolonged by the dealer personnel, processes, shop scheduling and/or practices are
considered the responsibility of the dealership
Field Action Courtesy Transportation Policy
GM Courtesy Transportation can only be provided during a Field Action repair when:
• The customer is eligible for GM Courtesy Transportation per the guidelines listed in the GM Courtesy Transpor-
tation Program Bulletin 07-00-89-037, or
• The Field Action Bulletin specifically includes provisions for courtesy transportation beyond the Warranty
Coverage period (in this situation, the procedure in the applicable bulletin should be followed)
Courtesy Transportation Options
Same-Day Repairs *- Shuttle Service Allowances
•Shuttle Service  - Providing a shuttle of the customer from/to the dealer is the preferred transportation alternative
and should be considered any time a warranty service appointment is scheduled, or an eligible vehicle is
brought in for a warranty repair. The dealer can submit up to $7.50 each way for shuttle service provided. If the
dealer does not operate a shuttle service, then the customer may utilize public transportation (taxi, bus, train,
Ride-hailing and Carsharing such as Lyft/Uber etc.) and submit original receipt(s) for reimbursement consider-
ation up to $7.50 each way. Shuttle of the customer’s vehicle to/from the dealership is a covered service
per the Courtesy Transportation Program
Note: Shuttle reimbursement cannot be claimed in conjunction with Mobile Service+ allowances.
* Cadillac Customers may be offered any transportation option for same-day repairs.
* Chevrolet, Buick, and GMC customers may be offered same-day service loaners in conjunction with the Chevrolet,
Buick and GMC Courtesy Transportation Program (CTP) Guidelines.
Overnight Repairs – Non-Loaner Vehicle Allowances
•Reimbursement for Fuel Provided  - When an eligible vehicle is unavailable due to overnight warranty repairs,
customers who elect to utilize rides from another person (i.e., friend, neighbor, etc.) in lieu of a loaner vehicle
Bulletin No.: 07-00-89-037V February, 2025 Page 3
may receive reimbursement for their actual cost (based on paid receipts) of fuel purchased up to $15 per day,
$45 maximum
•Reimbursement for Use of Public Transportation/Ride-hailing and Carsharing Apps  - When an eligible vehicle is
unavailable due to overnight warranty repairs, customers who use any form of public transportation or ride-
sharing (such as Lyft/Uber) in lieu of a loaner vehicle may receive reimbursement for their actual cost based on
receipts provided up to $38 per day, $114 maximum
Overnight Repairs – Loaner Reimbursement Allowances
Important: Properly scheduled service appointments increase dealership efficiency and customer satisfaction, while
minimizing vehicle repair time. If the vehicle cannot be serviced the same day and is still operative and safe to drive,
the customer should be encouraged to drive the vehicle. Scheduling service visits late in the afternoon or immedi-
ately prior to a weekend or holiday when service will not be performed until the next working day does not constitute
an overnight repair unless the vehicle is inoperative or otherwise unsafe to operate. Availability of loaner vehicles
should be considered, when possible, in appointment scheduling.
