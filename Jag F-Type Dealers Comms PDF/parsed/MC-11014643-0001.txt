When trying to perform clutch pack set up for the HD NQH the tool currently called out, DT -
48213-5 T ransfer Case Clutch P ack Height Measuring Adapter , is not available. 
There is no work around, so for transfer cases needing clutch pack related repairs, you will
need to replace the complete assembly . 
Please mak e sure to get the clutch identiﬁer from the tag of the new transfer case
assembly that needs to be loaded into the transfer case control module.
For vehicles with shudder/bind on turns in auto 4wd where clutches are suspect, please
see the latest version of TSB 19-NA-136 .
For these types of complaints, it has been noted that changing the ﬂuid then driving the
vehicle, shifting between 2wd and 4wd about 10 times then changing the ﬂuid a second
time has the best result. (Currently TSB revision being discussed)
