DESCRIPTION
Some vehicles may experience differential oil leaking from the oil seal (RH side) at the front differential. This is caused by 
an inappropriate assembly process of the front differential to the oil pan (vehicle side). To eliminate this concern the front 
differential assembly process has been changed.  
Customers having this concern should have their vehicle repaired using the following repair procedure.   
 
REPAIR PROCEDURE
1. Verify the customer concern.  
2. Drain the front differential oil [FRONT DIFFERENTIAL OIL REPLACEMENT (AWD)].  
3. Remove the front differential [FRONT DIFFERENTIAL REMOVAL/INSTALLATION (AWD)].  
NOTE:  Lower the engine component 2.0 in (50 mm), then remove the intermediate shaft bolt (lower) [INTERMEDIATE 
SHAFT REMOVAL/ INSTALLATION].  
4. Replace the LH side front oil seal (side gear).
a. Remove the front oil seal (side gear) from the front differential carrier using a flathead screwdriver.
NOTE: To prevent damaging the inside of the front differential casing, wrap a cloth on the end of the screwdriver.

b. Install the new front oil seal (side gear) using the SST and a hammer.
NOTE:
Install the front oil seals (side gear) straight.•
DO NOT insert the seal until it stops moving. There is a risk of oil leakage due to surface pressure 
decrease.•
If the SST is not available, the seal can be installed manually by hand. Make sure the seal is installed 
straight in the bore.•

6. Clean any oil residue from oil pan to differential matting surface (blue section).  
 
NOTE: If there is dirt or residue of liquid gasket around below hatched area, the differential may leak oil.  
 
 
7. Apply a small amount of grease to the engine oil pan surface with the front differential.  
NOTE:
Any one of the three options of grease listed below can be used (or an equivalent).•
This procedure is to prevent deformation of the differential oil seal lip during installation.•
 
 
 
 
 
 
[How to apply grease to engine oil pan]  
(1) Put small amount of grease on your finger.  
(2) Apply a thin layer of grease all around.
