Correction:  
Vehicle ma y have P06DD set as current or history . Verify the engine oil pressure is erratic
at an idle. F or example, the oil pressure will typically be toggling very rapidly at an idle
when engine oil temperature is warm. 
Remove the balancer shaft assembly and inspect the four piston oil nozzles for missing the
center portion. The center portion parts that came out of the piston nozzle, ma y be sitting
on top of the balancer shaft assembly , in the oil pick up screen or in the bottom of the oil
pan. 
Some of the components from the center portion ma y not be found as they ma y have
exited the engine through the oil drain plug opening during an oil change. 
Replace all four piston oil nozzles if any of them are found to be damaged.
 
#1 is pointing to a piston oil nozzle that still has the center portion.
 
 
#2 is pointing to a piston oil nozzle that is missing the center portion.  
 
The pictures below , are examples of the components that are the center portion of piston
oil nozzles.
