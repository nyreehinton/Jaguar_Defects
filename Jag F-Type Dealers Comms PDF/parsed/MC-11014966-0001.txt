DESCRIPTION
 
This document will guide the user through replacement of the two hose clamps at the right rear coolant distribution housing to
the large coolant return tube leading to the thermostat housing (Figure #1) .  The original clamp design may not be adequate to
maintain the proper clamping force in the event the rubber hose relaxes.  The steps below will outline the installation of a new
design constant torque clamp in this location.
