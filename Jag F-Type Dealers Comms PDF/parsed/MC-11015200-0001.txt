Condition
Customer complains of a check engine light. Faults P017100 and/or P017400 (Lean mixture Bank 1/2) may be 
stored in the fault memory of the DME.
Technical Background 
Dirt, debris, or silicone-based cleaning products can clog the ambient pressure sensor in the DME and lead to an  
incorrect air-fuel mixture. This tends to occur above 1,000m (3,300ft) of elevation but is possible at any altitude.
Service Information 
Please replace the DME with the newest available part number.
