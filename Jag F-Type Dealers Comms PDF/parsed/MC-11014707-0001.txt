Introduction  
Certain Volvo VN (4) model trucks may experience accelerated battery drain due to continuous 
power consumption by the Vehicle Master Control Unit (VMCU) and other modules. Depleted 
batteries can lead to starting issues and trigger erroneous warning lamps and fault codes ac ross 
various truck modules. Follow the instructions below to replace the VMCU, verify the correct pin 
location on the blue VMCU connector , use PTT to program the control modules , and replace  the 
battery sensor s (if applicable) .
