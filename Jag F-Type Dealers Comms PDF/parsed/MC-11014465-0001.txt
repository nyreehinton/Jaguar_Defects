Correction:
If within MY23/MY24 L yriq pA WD (X OE) VIN List – replace the BECM

MY23 PZ000729 - PZ002972
MY24 RZ010001 - RZ010024
 
If not within MY23/MY24 L yriq pA WD (X OE) VIN List, Or still has same issue after BECM replacement from above
vehicles listed , Continue with V eriﬁcation Steps:
Using GDS2 Navigate to Battery Energy Control Module(BECM) > HV Data
Check the following parameters:
Pack V oltage
Positive Mid-P ack V oltage
Negative Mid-P ack V oltage
If any of these values are 0V , this conﬁrms a potential calibration error .  Engineering is actively working on a resolution.
Next Steps:
Perform SPS2 Hybrid/EV Data Retrieval Process*
Start a T AC case via DCM (Dealer case management)
Submit GDS2 V oltage data & SPS2 Hybrid/EV Data Retrieval Warranty Claim Code via the T AC case
Next steps will be provided once the data extract has been reviewed
