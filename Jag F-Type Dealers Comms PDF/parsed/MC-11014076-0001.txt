GENERAL SAFETY GUIDELINES
WARNING! PLEASE READ AND
FOLLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS
TO AVOID PERSONAL INJURY OR DEATH:
When working on or around a vehicle, the following 
guidelines should be observed AT ALL TIMES :
 ▲Park the vehicle on a level surface, apply the parking 
brakes and always block the wheels.  Always wear personal 
protection equipment.  
 ▲Stop the engine and remove the ignition key when working 
under or around the vehicle.  When working in the engine 
compartment, the engine should be shut oﬀ   and the ignition 
key should be removed. Where circumstances require that 
the engine be in operation, EXTREME CAUTION  should be 
used to prevent personal injury resulting from contact with 
moving, rotating, leaking, heated or electrically-charged 
components.  
 ▲Do not attempt to install, remove, disassemble or 
assemble a component until you have read, and thoroughly 
understand, the recommended procedures.  Use only the 
proper tools and observe all precautions pertaining to use 
of those tools.
 ▲If the work is being performed on the vehicle’s air brake 
system, or any auxiliary pressurized air systems, make 
certain to drain the air pressure from all reservoirs before 
beginning ANY  work on the vehicle.  If the vehicle is 
equipped with a Bendix® AD-IS® air dryer system, a Bendix® 
DRM™ dryer reservoir module, a Bendix® AD-9si®, AD-HF®, 
or AD-HFi® air dryer, be sure to drain the purge reservoir.
 ▲ Following the vehicle manufacturer’s recommended 
procedures, deactivate the electrical system in a manner 
that safely removes all electrical power from the vehicle .
 ▲Never exceed manufacturer’s recommended pressures.  
 ▲Never connect or disconnect a hose or line containing 
pressure; it may whip and/or cause hazardous airborne 
dust and dirt particles. Wear eye protection. Slowly open 
connections with care, and verify that no pressure is 
present. Never remove a component or plug unless you are 
certain all system pressure has been depleted.
 ▲ Use only genuine Bendix® brand replacement parts, 
components and kits. Replacement hardware, tubing, hose, 
fi  ttings, wiring, etc. must be of equivalent size, type and 
strength as original equipment and be designed specifi  cally 
for such applications and systems.
 ▲Components with stripped threads or damaged parts should 
be replaced rather than repaired.  Do not attempt repairs 
requiring machining or welding unless specifi  cally stated 
and approved by the vehicle and component manufacturer.
 ▲Prior to returning the vehicle to service, make certain all 
components and systems are restored to their proper 
operating condition.
 ▲ For vehicles with Automatic Traction Control (ATC), the ATC 
function must be disabled (ATC indicator lamp should be 
ON) prior to performing any vehicle maintenance where 
one or more wheels on a drive axle are lifted oﬀ   the ground 
and moving.
 ▲The power MUST be temporarily disconnected from the 
radar sensor whenever any tests USING A DYNAMOMETER 
are conducted on a vehicle equipped with a Bendix® 
Wingman® system.
 ▲You should consult the vehicle manufacturer's operating 
and service manuals, and any related literature, in 
conjunction with the Guidelines above.
2DESCRIPTION
 IMPORT ANT
Do not install the core module included in this kit if it 
does not match the one being removed.
These kits are used to replace the Bendix® GSAT® (Global 
Scalable Air Treatment) core module. These are not retrofit 
kits. These kits cannot  be installed on vehicles that do 
not have an existing GSAT system. As shown in Figure 1 , 
there are several variants of the GSAT air dryer. Be sure to 
verify the core module included in this kit is identical 
to the core module you are replacing.  Ensure both core 
modules have the same port and mounting configurations 
in the same locations.
 
When replacing the core module assembly, it is mandatory 
that the air dryer cartridge and carbon filter be replaced. 
For replacement kit part numbers and instructions, refer 
to S-1693, Bendix® GSAT® (Global Scalable Air Treatment) 
Air Dryer Cartridge and Carbon Filter Kits for Volvo® 
Trucks, on B2Bendix.com.
NOTE: When replacing the air dryer cartridge, the cartridge 
lifetime wear and wetness content will need to be reset. Use 
Bendix® ACom® Diagnostic Software, or a Volvo® diagnostic 
tool, to initiate the cartridge reset routines.
VEHICLE PREPARATION
1.  Park the vehicle on a level surface and chock the wheels. 
2. Turn the ignition switch OFF. 
3. Drain all reservoirs to 0 psi (0 kpa).
4. Clean the exterior of the air dryer body to remove any 
dirt and debris. 
 
Always depressurize all air dryers and air reservoirs on 
the vehicle to 0 psi (0 kpa) before servicing the air dryer. 
Failure to drain the air pressure from all air dryers and 
air reservoirs may result in injury or death.

REQUIRED PROGRAMMING
Before placing the vehicle in service, the Bendix® GSAT 
(Global Scalable Air Treatment) system for Volvo® must be 
programmed to the OE configuration to properly function.
1. Use the Volvo diagnostic tool to update the configuration 
software per the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN).
2. When replacing the air dryer cartridge, the cartridge 
lifetime wear and wetness content will need to be reset. 
Use Bendix® ACom® Diagnostic Software, or a Volvo® 
diagnostic tool, to initiate the cartridge reset routines.OPERATIONAL TEST
Before placing the vehicle in service, perform the following 
tests.
1. Close all of the reservoir drain cocks.
2. With the engine at 1800 rpm, build up system pressure 
to system cut-out while observing that both the front axle 
(secondary) and rear axle (primary) service reservoir 
dash gauges rise equally in pressure from 0 psi (0 kpa) 
to system cut-out. If either gauge fails to display this 
condition, stop testing and check the installation. Note 
that the GSAT system regenerates/purges with an audible 
escape of air when system cut-out pressure is reached.
NOTE: The service reservoir pressures will drop during 
regeneration/purge.
3. Fan down the service brakes to reduce system air 
pressure to system cut-in. Note that the system – once 
again – builds to full system pressure and is followed 
by a regeneration/purge event at the GSAT air dryer 
primary exhaust.
4. To verify proper park brake function, use the Hand Control 
Unit (HCU) to release and apply the tractor park brakes 
several times. The HCU and/or dash cluster should 
illuminate, indicating a proper park state.
5. It is recommended that the following items be tested for 
leakage to ensure the GSAT will not cycle excessively:
a.  Air brake system ( Refer to the Bendix® Air Brake 
Handbook, BW5057,  on B2Bendix.com) 
b.  Compressor unloader mechanism per manufacturer's 
recommendation
c. GSAT core module
d.  Drain cock and safety valve in first (supply) reservoir 
(if equipped)
e.  All air connections leading to and from the first 
(supply) reservoir (if equipped)
