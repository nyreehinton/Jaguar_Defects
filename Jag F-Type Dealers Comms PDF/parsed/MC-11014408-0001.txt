Case Number: S2509000001
Release Date: February 2025 
Symptom/Vehicle Issue :  Engine Rattle Noise 
Customer Complaint/Technician Observation: Customer’s complaint may include a 
rattling noise coming from the engine.   
Discussion:  ** Make sure the engine reaches normal operating temperature (194°F-
230°F). Once it reaches normal temperature, turn the engine off.  Proceed with the 
steps below.** 
1. Start engine, wait 30 seconds, noise will be present after this time. 
2. Step on gas pedal and the noise will go away, release the gas pedal and noise 
will be present again.  Repeat 3 times.  If this is true, the noise might be phaser 
related. 
3. With the use of a stethoscope, confirm the bank where the noise is coming from 
(there is a high probability that it will come from the right bank).  
4. Once it's confirmed that this is phaser related and the bank has been confirmed 
(most likely right), replace the suspect phaser using the repair procedure 
outlined below. 
Repair Procedure:  ** ATTENTION:  THE REPAIR PROCEDURE BELOW IS A 
MODIFICATION TO THE CURRENTLY ISSUED SERVICE PROCEDURE IN
