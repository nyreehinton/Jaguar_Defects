PROCEDURE

about:blank 1/6
 1. Check the resistance of the seat-mounted air
bag before seat disassembly . 
 
Does the resistance change when sitting in
the seat, or moving on the outside seat
bolster? 
 
If resistance increases when moving on a
particular section the seat, then that is the
area to examine the wiring harness.
  
2. If problem is found to occur when there is
pressure on the outer seat bolster , it is not
necessary to remove the seat from the vehicle.  
 
Disassemble the backrest of the seat only
so you can access the harness for the seat
mounted side air bag.
 
Here you can see the harness is pulled
tightly around the seat backrest frame and
the area where we need to introduce some
slack.

3. The harness is held to the back of the seat frame
with a push-in clip. You can move this clip on the
wiring harness, or move the harness around to
introduce more slack.
 
4. If problem cannot be identified, follow Repair Instruction 72 12 051 to remove the seat leather . Check the
complete harness routing to see if it is pulled tightly or routed so that the electrical connector is under tension. 
 
NOTE : If you remove seat from vehicle, the 4 seat mounting bolts and 1 safety belt strap 
bolt must be replaced (refer to ETK per the VIN; tightening torque is 42 Nm per AIR).
 
5. If there is no damage to the wire insulation , routing the harness so it is not under tension once installed should
resolve the problem.
 
OR
 
If harness is damaged , then replace seat air bag assembly .
