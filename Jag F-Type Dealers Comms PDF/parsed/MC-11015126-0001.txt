 
Rivian Internal  Hi <customer name>,  
We’re reaching out about your Rivian. We identified a need to inspect your vehicle for a  potential 
issue that could result in being unable to access or drive your vehicle —and may even require a 
tow.   
Schedule an appointment with your local Rivian Service Center or with one of our qualified third -
party providers. Both options are covered under warranty at no cost to you.  
Whichever option you choose, give us a call to schedule your appointment at (855) 748 -4265.
