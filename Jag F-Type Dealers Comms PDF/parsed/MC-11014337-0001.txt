• Check harness continuity and look for any cable pinch or damage.  
• Check for proper installation, connector damage, proper coax cable lengths (no tension, center 
stack approximately 3 in away from IP), bent terminals or a terminal push ed out.  
• Plug all vehicle connections back in and perform ECU reset and erase DTCs.  
• DO NOT REPLACE ANY ANTENNA without an antenna ACTIVE DTC. Active antenna DTC 
must follow antenna service diagnostic procedure for that DTC in Service Library.  
• Turn ignition off min of 10 seconds  and turn back on and wait a MIN 6 minutes to see if the 
DTC changes from Active to Stored.  
• If the Uconnect message returns with an Active  Cell DTC, follow the service diagnostic 
procedure for that DTC  in Service Library.  
o 9977 -6-CELL -LTE Cell Antenna Test Kit  
o 9977 -6-9 RG -58 Coax Cable  
o 977-6-13 RG -58 Coax Cable, longer length.  
o Follow same procedure for the GPS antenna (if separate)  
• If the message returns with a Stored  Cell DTC, look for intermittent harness connections. This 
is not an antenna issue.  
• If the Uconnect message returns with no antenna DTC, run vehicle outside for 5 -6 minutes (to 
ensure proper cellular  coverage) to see if the message goes away. If message is still present, 
follow service procedure for TBM diagnostics. This is not an antenna issue.  
 
If the customer’s concerns could not be duplicated and DTC becomes stored, most likely this was due 
to an intermittent harness connection concern.
