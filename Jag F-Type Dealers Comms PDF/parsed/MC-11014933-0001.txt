Introduction of tri -crimp, Spiralock ™ chassis /aerial  hardware.  
Purpose/Background:  
• Pierce is  replacing  all 1/2”, 5/8”, and 3/4” Magni -black nuts  with tri-crimp Spiralock ™ nuts. This change 
from oval lock to Tri -crimp Spiralock ™ only affects 1/2”, 5/8”, and 3/4” hardware.  
• Spiralock ™ fasteners are being used by Pierce® primarily on frame builds  started in October 2021 (RFPs 
starting in February 2022). 
• Spiralock ™ nuts look similar to standard hardware but  require higher 
torque specifications.  
• Spiralock ™ nut threads have a special wedge ramp at the foot  of the 
thread allowing a continuous line of contact when a clamp load is applied.  
 
Hardware Identification:  
 
Installed hardware is noted on the Aerial placard when applicable.  
 NOTE:  The Aerial placard will denote what is installed on the 
apparatus at time of OEM build. If hardware is loose, we recommend changing to the Spiralock ™ hardware 
on both sides and having the placard updated or noted 
in the customer’s file.  
 However, suspension and other areas of installation require 
visual inspection during installation and service to determine appropriate torque values.   
(see pictures to right for identification details).

 Description/Procedure:   
Spiralock ™ nuts have higher torque specifications compared to standard fasteners as shown in the table below.  
NOTE:  A backing wrench must be used when torquing this hardware.  
NOTE:  If you have previously installed Spiralock ™ nuts you do not need to re -torque to the new values. If you 
need to replace a Spiralock ™ nut you must  torque to the new value.

 These new torque values can also be found in our chassis operators manuals  in the maintenance chapter under 
Frame Fasteners and in our service manuals  under the Fastener Identification, Torque Specifications & Locking 
Mechanisms chapter.  
Aerial Torque Box Application:  A ll Aerials and Tillers, Excluding New 100 AAT (Ascendant Aerial Tower)  
If determined to replace just 1 magni -black nut  with the tri-crimp Spiralock ™ nut on the torque box, then you 
MUST  change all Torque Box hardware to the tri -crimp Spiralock ™ along with ordering a new Data Placard to 
reflect the new Torque Value of the changed hardware on the Torque Box.  
NOTE:  Data Placard can be ordered through Pierce Parts Team.    
Torque Tool Recommendations:  
 
The following tools have been identified for better access  to hard-to-reach  
hardware. It is critical that you use a backing wrench at all times. These may

NOTE:   Current ly installed hardware is not defective. You do not have to change all hardware to the Spiralock ™. 
It is suggested, during periodic inspections, if hardware is loo se, you may choose to replace the nut (new 
part number) and the bolt (original part number) to minimize future serviceability.
