DESCRIPTION
Some vehicles may experience the front inner brake pads wear out faster than the outside. For example, the brake pads 
need to be replaced at less than 12,500 miles (20,000km). This accelerated pad wear may be caused by dirt and sand 
easily adhering to the inner friction surface of the disc while driving. To eliminate this concern, the shape of the dust 
cover has been changed and modification of the front brake pads is under study.  
Customers having this concern should have their vehicle repaired using the following repair procedure.   
 
REPAIR PROCEDURE
1. Verify the customer concern.  
2. Replace the brake pads and both dust covers with modified ones following the instructions in MGS.
