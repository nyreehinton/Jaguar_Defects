Failure Code CC Customer Concern
The dealer must use failure code CC with this Technical Service Bulletin.
● If the customer’s concern matches the SYMPTOM identified in the Technical Service Bulletin, failure code
CC is to be used.
● When utilizing this failure code, the 3C’s (customer’s concern, cause and correction) must be provided for
processing Technical Service Bulletin flash/reprogramming conditions.
DIAGNOSIS:
Using a Scan Tool (wiTECH) with the appropriate Diagnostic Procedures available in DealerCONNECT/
Service Library, verify all related systems are functioning as designed. If DTCs or symptom conditions, other
than the ones listed above are present, record the issues on the repair order and repair as necessary before

REPAIR PROCEDURE:
NOTE: This vehicle has two ECMs (Primary and Secondary). Both must be updated to the latest
available software. The Primary ECM must be programmed first then the Secondary ECM2
(both known as PCMs).
NOTE: Install a battery charger to ensure battery voltage does not drop below 13.2 volts. Do not allow
the charging voltage to climb above 13.5 volts during the flash process.
NOTE: If this flash process is interrupted/aborted, the flash should be restarted.
NOTE: The TCM must be updated to the latest available software at the conclusion of this repair
procedure. Refer to all applicable published technical service bulletins for detailed repair
procedures and labor times regarding updating the TCM software.
CAUTION!
Failure to update the TCM module following an PCM software update may result in vehicle
malfunctions.M18 FSAR-TSB-5058 -2-
1. Reprogram the PCM (Primary) with the latest software. **If issues arise when flashing a module using the
wiTECH Diagnostic Application, please submit a ticket to the Helpdesk. The helpdesk can be found within
the Help menu.**
2. Reprogram the PCM (Secondary) with the latest software. **If issues arise when flashing a module using
the wiTECH Diagnostic Application, please submit a ticket to the Helpdesk. The helpdesk can be found
within the Help menu.**
3. Perform the "Control unit reprogramming" routine in wiTECH located in the ECM “Misc. Functions” menu
tab.
4. Perform the "Control unit reprogramming" routine in wiTECH located in the ECM2 “Misc. Functions” menu
tab.
NOTE: Before performing the next two steps, the ignition must be in the on position, engine off
and engine temperature must be above 80 °C (176 °F).
5. Perform the "Oil level sensor replacement" routine in wiTECH located in the ECM2 “Misc. Functions” menu
tab.
6. Verify the TCM is also programmed with the latest available software. Refer to all applicable published
service bulletins for detailed repair procedures and labor times regarding updating the TCM software.
7. Clear any DTCs that may have been set in any modules due to reprogramming. The wiTECH application
will automatically present all DTCs after the flash and allow them to be cleared.
