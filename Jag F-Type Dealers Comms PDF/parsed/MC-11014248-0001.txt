Avis de rappel de véhicules automobiles - Campagne de rappel de Transports Canada no 2024 -252 Campagne 
Newmar no 610 RSB  
 
Cher client apprécié  : 
Le présent avis vous est envoyé conformément aux exigences de la  Loi sur la sécurité automobile . 
La présente a pour but de vous informer que votre véhicule est susceptible d’être non conforme aux exigences 
du Règlement sur la sécurité des véhicules automobiles  et que la non -conformité pourrait porter atteinte à la sécurité 
humaine . 
RAISON DE CE RAPPEL  
Newmar Corporation a décidé qu'un défaut, lié à la sécurité des véhicules automobiles, existe dans certains 
camping- cars Bay Star Classe A 2022, équipés d'une gamme de plaques de cuisson Suburban. La carte de circuit 
imprimé de rétroéclairage à DEL de la gamme de table de cuisson peut tomber en panne, ce qui provoque une 
surchauffe de la carte.  
Question en litige :  
Sur un camping- car, la carte de circuit imprimé pour les anneaux de lumière LED sur les boutons de la table de 
cuisson pourrait tomber en panne. Par conséquent, le câblage et/ou les lumières LED pourraient surchauffer et 
fondre.  
Remarque : Ce rappel ne touche que les camping- cars équipés de certaines tables de cuisson Suburban.  
 
Risque pour la sécurité :  
Le câblage et/ou les lumières qui surchauffent et fondent peuvent créer le risque d'incendie.  
 
Mesures correctives :  
Newmar avisera le propriétaire par la poste et lui conseillera d'apporter son camping- car chez un concessionnaire 
pour désactiver ou retirer les anneaux de lumière à DEL et les remplacer par un nouveau panneau de commande.  
Les camping -cars nécessitent un service immédiat.  L'utilisation continue présente un danger potentiel pour la 
sécurité.  
CE QUE NOUS ALLONS FAIRE  
Newmar avisera le propriétaire par la poste et lui demandera d'apporter son camping -car à une installation de 
service autorisée pour faire remplacer le panneau de commande. Cette réparation devrait prendre environ .3 heure pour le remplacement du panneau de commande. Cependant, en raison de certains temps de planification 
de service, le centre de service peut avoir besoin de votre véhicule pour une période plus longue. Toutes les 
réparations seront effectuées gratuitement pour le client.
