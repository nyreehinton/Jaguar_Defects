Field Issue Description  
 
In several cases, we’ve detected cracks formation on the Central Tunnel Moulding (carbon finishing) in 
different areas  (see pics. below).  
For this reason and from  now on the Cupholder , the  Phone box  and the Central trim are available as 
single spare part s for giving you the chance to replace the affected component  only; then i n case of 
warranty request s, whenever it ’s possible, they MUST  be singularly ordered instead of the complete Central 
Tunnel Moulding . Warranty Claims differently managed than these  Circular Letter  instructions  will be 
subject to further review.
