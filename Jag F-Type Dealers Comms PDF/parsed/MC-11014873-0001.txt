2GENERAL SAFETY GUIDELINES
WARNING! PLEASE READ AND
FOLLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS
TO AVOID PERSONAL INJURY OR DEATH:
When working on or around a vehicle, the following 
guidelines should be observed AT ALL TIMES :
 ▲Park the vehicle on a level surface, apply the parking 
brakes and always block the wheels.  Always wear personal 
protection equipment.  
 ▲Stop the engine and remove the ignition key when working 
under or around the vehicle.  When working in the engine 
compartment, the engine should be shut off   and the ignition 
key should be removed. Where circumstances require that 
the engine be in operation, EXTREME CAUTION  should be 
used to prevent personal injury resulting from contact with 
moving, rotating, leaking, heated or electrically-charged 
components.  
 ▲Do not attempt to install, remove, disassemble or 
assemble a component until you have read, and thoroughly 
understand, the recommended procedures.  Use only the 
proper tools and observe all precautions pertaining to use 
of those tools.
 ▲If the work is being performed on the vehicle’s air brake 
system, or any auxiliary pressurized air systems, make 
certain to drain the air pressure from all reservoirs before 
beginning ANY  work on the v ehicle.  If the v ehicle is  
equipped with a Bendix® AD-IS® air dryer system, a Bendix® 
DRM™ dryer reservoir module, a Bendix® AD-9si®, AD-HF®, 
or AD-HFi® air dryer, be sure to drain the purge reservoir.
 ▲ Following the vehicle manufacturer’s recommended 
procedures, deactivate the electrical system in a manner 
that safely removes all electrical power from the vehicle .
 ▲Never exceed manufacturer’s recommended pressures.  
 ▲Never connect or disconnect a hose or line containing 
pressure; it may whip and/or cause hazardous airborne 
dust and dirt particles. Wear eye protection. Slowly open 
connections with care, and verify that no pressure is 
present. Never remove a component or plug unless you are 
certain all system pressure has been depleted.
 ▲ Use only genuine Bendix® brand replacement parts, 
components and kits. Replacement hardware, tubing, hose, 
ﬁ  ttings, wiring, etc. must be of equivalent size, type and 
strength as original equipment and be designed speciﬁ  cally 
for such applications and systems.
 ▲Components with stripped threads or damaged parts should 
be replaced rather than repaired.  Do not attempt repairs 
requiring machining or welding unless speciﬁ  cally stated 
and approved by the vehicle and component manufacturer.
 ▲Prior to returning the vehicle to service, make certain all 
components and systems are restored to their proper 
operating condition.
 ▲ For vehicles with Automatic Traction Control (ATC), the ATC 
function must be disabled (ATC indicator lamp should be 
ON) prior to performing any vehicle maintenance where 
one or more wheels on a drive axle are lifted off   the ground 
and moving.
 ▲The power MUST be temporarily disconnected from the 
radar sensor whenever any tests USING A DYNAMOMETER 
are conducted on a vehicle equipped with a Bendix® 
Wingman® system.
 ▲You should consult the vehicle manufacturer's operating 
and service manuals, and any related literature, in 
conjunction with the Guidelines above.DISASSEMBLY

See Figure 1.
Ensure the vehicle is safe to work on before beginning. Follow 
all General Safety Guidelines  in this document.
1. Block and hold the vehicle on a level surface by means 
other than the air brakes.

LOG ON AND LEARN FROM THE BEST OPERATING AND LEAKAGE TESTS
 IMPORT ANT
It is recommended that the operating and leakage tests 
be performed prior to installation on the vehicle.
1. Connect a 120 psi air source to the supply. An accurate 
test gauge should be tee'd into each airline and a means 
of controlling the air pressure provided. 
2. A small volume with a gauge should be connected to 
the delivery port.
3. With 120 psi supply pressure and the valve in the released 
position (plunger up), the gauge at the delivery port 
should read 0 psi.
4. Leakage at the exhaust port should not exceed a 1-in. 
bubble in five (5) seconds. No leakage is permitted 
between the body and the lower cap nut (15).
5. With 120 psi supply pressure, operate the valve (push 
plunger down). The gauge at the delivery port should 
read 120 psi.
6. Leakage at the exhaust port and between the body and 
the upper cap nut (3) should not exceed a 1-in. bubble 
in five (5) seconds. 
7. The valve must return to the release position without 
assistance when the manual force is removed.ASSEMBLY
See Figure 1.
1. Prior to assembly, lubricate the o-rings and bearing 
surfaces with the lubricant included in the maintenance kit.
2. Install the new o-ring (10) on the piston (8).
3. Install the new o-ring (4) on the plunger (1).
4. Install the new inlet and exhaust valve (12), the retained 
spring (16), and the retained retainer (13) in the valve
