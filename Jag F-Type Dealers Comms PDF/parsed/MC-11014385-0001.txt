SYMPTOM:Some customers may report that on occasion, vehicle exterior head lamp assemblies are fogged with a
light layer of condensation on the inside of the lenses.
CAUSE: Headlamp condensation
This bulletin supersedes Technical Service Bulletin (TSB) 23-004-24 REV. A, date of issue August 06,
2024, which should be removed from your files. All revisions are highlighted with **asterisks** and
include an additional model year.
DISCUSSION:
This TSB is to communicate the procedure for headlamp condensation clearing.
STANDARD PROCEDURE - Lamp Lens Defogging:
NOTE: Figures are not specific to vehicle and only used for showing the headlamps either good or
bad, per the TSB.
Customers may report that on occasion, vehicle exterior headlamp assemblies are fogged with a light layer of
condensation on the inside of the lenses Fig. 1 .
This may be reported after the headlamps have been turned on and brought up to operating temperature,
turned off and then rapidly cooled by cold water (such as rain, or the water from a vehicle wash). Headlamp
lens fogging can also occur under certain atmospheric conditions after a vehicle has been parked outside
overnight (i.e. a warm humid day followed by clear cool night).
This will usually clear as atmospheric conditions change to allow the condensation to change back into a
vapor. Turning the headlamp ON will usually accelerate this process.

Fogged Headlamp Examples
A headlamp that exhibits condensation/fogging Fig. 1  should be evaluated in a service bay environment
according to the following steps:
1. Dry all water from the outside surface of the headlamp lens.
2. Operating all outside lamps for 20 minutes by:
● Starting the vehicle engine.
● Turning ON the vehicle headlamps and turn ON the hazard warning flashers.
Evaluation Criteria:
If the condensation/fogging has begun to clear Fig, 2  from the headlamp lens after 20 minutes with the lamps
operating, this indicates the lamp sealing has not been breached, and the headlamp does NOT need to be
replaced.
Fig. 2
Condensation/Fogging Beginning To Clear Examples
If the condensation/fogging has not begun to clear after 20 minutes with the headlamps operating, or the
headlamp has large amounts of water droplets visible on most internal surfaces, this indicates a problem with
the headlamp sealing that has allowed water to enter the headlamp. In this instance, the customer is also likely
to report that moisture in the headlamp is always present and never disappears Fig. 3 .M23 FSAR-TSB-5076 -2-
NOTE: A headlamp that exhibits internal moisture permanently Fig. 3  should be replaced.

Condensation/Fogging Not Beginning To Clear Examples
Most Common Causes For Heavy Non-normal Condensation/Fogging In Headlamp Assemblies:
●Damage:  Breakage on the headlamp housing will allow moisture/water to enter to the headlamp (damage,
cracks, holes, etc.) Fig. 4 . If this is noticed, the Failure Code must be recorded accordingly: 11/BROKEN
OR CRACKED .
Fig. 4
Cracked, Damaged Or Broken Headlamp Examples
●Missing Sealing Components:  Missing vent caps, access caps or bulb sockets will allow moisture/ water
to enter to the head lamp Fig. 5 . If this is noticed, the Failure Code must be recorded accordingly: 1C /
CONNECTOR LOOSE NOT ATTACHED .
Fig. 5
Missing Sealing Components Examples
1 - Missing Vent Cap
2 - Missing Access Cap
3 - Missing Bulb Socket
4 - Missing Bulb Socket-3- M23 FSAR-TSB-5076
●Sealing Components:  Missing/damaged vent caps, incorrectly installed access caps and bulb sockets, will
allow moisture/water to enter to the head lamp Fig. 6 . If this is noticed, the Failure Code must be recorded
accordingly: 1C / CONNECTOR LOOSE NOT ATTACHED .

Incorrectly Installed Access Caps Examples
If no obvious causes are observed, proceed using the failure code for leaks (65) and replace the headlamps
accordingly. Refer to the detailed service procedures available in DealerCONNECT/Service Library under:
