Code G1DAG) - Buzzing/Clicking/Humming/Ticking Sound From OHC And/Or
P24AE DTC In The HVAC Module - Lower Level Service Part
Some 2020-2025 Aviator vehicles equipped with auto air refresh option (minor feature code G1DAG) may
exhibit a buzzing/clicking/humming/ticking sound from the overhead console (OHC) and/or diagnostic trouble
code (DTC) P24AE in the heating ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) module. To confirm if a vehicle is built
with a certain minor feature code, review the build information by double-clicking the vehicle identification
number (VIN) in the upper left corner in the Professional Technician System (PTS). If diagnostics lead to the in-
vehicle air quality particulate sensor as the causal part, a new lower level part is available. It is not necessary
to replace the OHC assembly if only the sensor is suspect. Use part number L1MZ-19F666-A to resolve the
concern.
