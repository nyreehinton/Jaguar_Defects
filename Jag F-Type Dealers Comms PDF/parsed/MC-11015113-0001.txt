WRG2 - Check Power Windows and Replace if  Necessary (Workshop Campaign)
Model Line: 911 (992)
Model Year: As of 2024 up to 2025
Concerns: Front power windows mechanism
Cause: There is a possibility that a power windows mecha nism was installed in the front doors that does
not meet the required speci ﬁcations on the affected vehicles.
If this is the case, the design differences mean that the door window does not fully retract into the door.
Action: Check the end position of the front left and right door window and replace the respective front power
windows mechanism depending on the result.
Affected
Vehicles:Only the vehicles assigned to the campaign (see also PCSS Vehicle Information).
