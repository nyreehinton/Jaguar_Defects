whichever is the earlier.  If the vehicle annual operat ing mileage is less than 30,000miles (48,000km) then 
the following wheel hub maintenance is to be done once every year.  If the vehicle annual operat ing mileage is greater th an 30,000miles (48,000km) 
then the following wheel hub maintenance is to be carried out every 30,000miles

2. Using a dial indicator gauge measure the mounted hub bearing end play figure. 
The tolerance specifications are as follows: 
 
Hub Bearing End Play Tolerance Specification 
 
For a new bearing in a new hub the maximu m tolerance for end play is 0.075mm 
 
 
For a new bearing in a used hub the maxi mum tolerance for end play is 0.105mm 
 
 For a used bearing in a used hub the maximu m tolerance for end play is 0.200mm 
 
 
3. If mounted hub bearing en dplay figure is found to be above the tolerance 
specification the beari ng should be replaced.
