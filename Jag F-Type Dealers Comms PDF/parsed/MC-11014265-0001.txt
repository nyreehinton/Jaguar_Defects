Case Number:   S2219000005  Rev. C  
 
 
Release Date:   February 2025  
 
 
Symptom/Vehicle Issue : Check Engine Lamp On . Warning Messages In The Cluster .  
U0131 Lost Communication With  Power Steering Control Module Set.  
 
 
Customer Complaint/Technician Observation : Customer may mention service 
electric steering message in the cluster along with other warnings  and lamps . They 
may complain the Electronic Power Steering ( EPS) assist was lost at start up for a key 
cycle. Technicians may find modules reporting U0131 Lost Communication Diagnostic 
Trouble Code (DTC) set against the EPS.  
 
 
Discussion : First, review any applicable  service bulletins and information that may 
apply to a customer complaint.  If DTC U0131 Lost Communication with Power Steering 
Control Module is set, do not start with replacing the EPS. Verify the EPS connectors 
are fully snapped in by pushing on the connectors. Comments  from field technicians  
show concerns with the amount of grease found in the EPS connectors. The amount 
shown in the images is applied at assembly and is correct. Dielectric grease is used in 
this location due the EPS location and contact with moisture  and IS NOT the cause of 
U0131 DTC . Do not add to or remove the factory applied grease. Inspect the pins for 
push out and damage such as being bent. I nspect the EPS ground locations . Clean 
connection points  and tighten grounding cables .
