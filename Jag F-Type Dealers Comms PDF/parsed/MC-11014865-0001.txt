 SUBJECT: Walnut Blast Cleaning Procedure for Carbon   
  Deposit Removal to Address Engine Misfire DTCs,  
  Black Smoke from the Exhaust, Lack of Power,  
  Knocking (Ping) and / or Rough Idle Concerns
INTRODUCTION: 
This bulletin provides updated parts information and a service procedure to follow for removing 
accumulated carbon deposits from fuel injectors and internal engine components (e.g. intake valves 
and / or manifold, and combustion chambers). Fuel quality and how the vehicle is operated are both 
major contributing factors which will have a direct effect on carbon deposit accumulation. This 
cleaning procedure for carbon deposit removal is recommended to address engine misfire DTCs, 
black smoke from the exhaust, lack of power, knocking (ping) and / or rough idle concerns. The 
procedure outlines the use of an Autool HTS558 Walnut Blasting Machine that has been approved by 
Subaru of America. 
IMPORTANT: This procedure was developed as a suitable alternative to the procedures outlined in 
09-74-21R due to available retailer equipment. ONLY one procedure can be reimbursed by Warranty.

SERVICE PROCEDURE / INFORMATION:
STEP 1: Refer to the applicable Service Manual and review: General Description > Repair Contents 
> Action required before & after Battery Disconnect . Additionally, record any stored seat position(s) 
before proceeding. Relearn any seat position memory after work is complete. If the power rear gate 
(PRG) height has been customized, that position must also be noted and relearned. 
STEP 2: Remove the battery as per the applicable Service Manual: Engine > STARTING/
CHARGING SYSTEMS > Battery > Removal
STEP 3: Remove the intake manifold as per the applicable Service Manual: Engine > FUEL  
INJECTION (FUEL SYSTEMS) > Intake Manifold Assembly > Removal
IMPORTANT CAUTIONS:  
• The Service Manual uses a black star (★) in the component breakdown illustrations to 
indicate one-time use parts.
• It is vital to confirm no foreign matter enters any fuel lines, intake ducts, and any other 
peripheral parts. 
• 2.0L & 2.5L DINA equipped models DO NOT require fuel delivery tube disconnection

Bulletin Number: 02-193-24R;  Revised: 02/17/25         Page 4 of 11
Continued...STEP 4: Cover/seal the required areas indicated in the model specific images below . Proceed to Step 
5 for 2.0L & 2.5L DINA equipped models. 
2.0L DIT & 2.4L DIT:  Cover the turbo charger duct opening with making tape.  
2.4L DIT: Install the cap (p.n. 16519AA100) on to the high pressure fuel pump connection.  
STEP 5: Rotate the crank pully clockwise until the timing mark matches the position indicated 
below. 

Bulletin Number: 02-193-24R;  Revised: 02/17/25         Page 5 of 11
Continued...STEP 6: Visually inspect the intake valves of cylinders #1 and #3. Confirm the valves are in the 
closed position.  
NOTE: If the valves are open, rotate the crank pully 360 degrees in the clockwise direction and 
monitor the valve position. DO NOT continue until the valves are confirmed to be closed. 
STEP 7: Seal the intake ports of cylinders #2 and 
#4 with masking tape. This will prevent any foreign 
material from entering.  
CAUTION: Contamination or adhesion of foreign 
material such as walnut shell media  
inside the engine may cause starting failure  
and/or engine stalling.  
STEP 8: Cover the area around the intake port with two moving blankets. This will help prevent any 
walnut shell material from contamination. 

Bulletin Number: 02-193-24R;  Revised: 02/17/25         Page 6 of 11
Continued...
CAUTION: Confirm harness connections, fuels lines, and ALL other components are covered prior 
to cleaning. 
STEP 9: Prepare the walnut blasting machine (AUTOOL HTS558) with the necessary air supply. 
Always use NEW abrasive material when performing cleaning.  
STEP 10: Prepare the angled suction hose by inserting the square yellow adapter onto the end of the 
hose. Allow approximately 10mm of the hose to protrude from the adapter. This will provide added 
stability when cleaning.  

Bulletin Number: 02-193-24R;  Revised: 02/17/25         Page 7 of 11
Continued...STEP 11: Set the hose into the cylinder #1 intake port. Cover any gaps with a shop towel.  
STEP 12: Clean the intake valve and intake port of cylinders #1.
A. Confirm the walnut blaster is turned on. 
B. Insert the nozzle of the walnut blaster into the suction hose. 
C. Pull the trigger and allow the abrasive material to pass through the nozzle. 
D. Aim the nozzle in the direction of Valve A. 
E. Aim the nozzle in the direction of Valve B. 
F. Move the nozzle up, down, left, and right to ensure the entire area is cleaned. 
 
CAUTION: DO NOT  remove the nozzle from suction hose while blasting the abrasive material. 
This can cause contamination to the surrounding area. 
 
TIP: A seal pick can be used for the removal of  
some of the more difficult to remove carbon deposits. 
Be careful not to scratch the valves or cylinder head.

Continued...STEP 13: Repeat the cleaning process outlined in Step 12 for cylinder #3.  
STEP 14: After cleaning is completed, remove any remaining abrasive material using the suction 
hose. Using a flashlight, inspect the ports and confirm there is no remaining material.  
STEP 15: Remove the moving blankets and masking tape covering the intake ports on cylinders #2 
and #4. 
CAUTION:  Be mindful not to spread any of the abrasive material collected by the blankets into the 
engine area. 
STEP 16: Rotate the crank pully clockwise 360 degrees until the timing mark matches the position 
indicated below. 
STEP 17: Visually inspect the intake valves of cylinders #2 and #4. Confirm the valves are in the 
closed position.  

Bulletin Number: 02-193-24R;  Revised: 02/17/25         Page 9 of 11
Continued...STEP 18: Seal the intake ports of cylinders #1 and #3 with 
masking tape. This will prevent any foreign material from 
entering.  
CAUTION: Contamination or adhesion of foreign material 
such as walnut shell media inside the engine may cause 
starting failure and/or engine stalling.  
STEP 19: Cover the area around the intake port with two moving blankets. This will help prevent any 
walnut shell material from contamination.
CAUTION: Confirm harness connections, fuels lines, and ALL other components are covered prior 
to cleaning. 
STEP 20: Repeat the procedures outlined in Steps 9 through 15 on cylinders #2 and #4.  
 

Bulletin Number: 02-193-24R;  Revised: 02/17/25         Page 10 of 11
Continued...STEP 21: Clean the plate and stick portions of all the cylinder head plates using throttle plate cleaner . 
Dry the cylinder head plates with a clean shop towel. Confirm there is no cleaner remaining on the 
plates. 
STEP 22: Clean the throttle body.
A. Remove the throttle body from the intake manifold.  
B. Soak a shop towel in throttle plate cleaner.
C.  Wipe the throttle valve and bore inner surfaces from both the intake manifold and intake 
duct sides. 
D. Wipe the cleaned areas with a clean shop towel and confirm no throttle plate cleaner remains. 
CAUTION: DO NOT open and close the throttle valve manually during cleaning. DO NOT deform 
or scratch the throttle valve/bore. 
STEP 23: Reinstall all parts in the reverse order of disassembly. 
STEP 24: Fill the fuel tank fuel. Add one bottle of P.E.A. carbon cleaner (SOA868V9166) the fuel   
           tank.
NOTES: 
• The Service Manual uses a black star (★) in the component breakdown illustrations to 
indicate one-time use parts.
• Whenever reconnecting the ground cable terminal to the battery sensor, torque to 7.5Nm 
(5.5ft.-lbs. or 66inch-lbs.) while supporting the sensor with the other hand as outlined in the 
applicable Service Manual under: STARTING/CHARGING SYSTSEMS > Battery Sensor.
