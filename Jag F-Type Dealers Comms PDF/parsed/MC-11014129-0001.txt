Technical Journal 37071.4.0SERVICE:
* Text in #3, #7, #7a, #7b, #8, #8a and #8b is changed, updated or added.
#1. If SWDL fails and the HLCM is in “Not responding” , it is normal. HLCM is in silent mode and 
therefore not listening to diagnostic commands.
 Continue with the next SWDL attempt without any action.
#2. If SWDL fails due to Silent mode (picture VIDA1_EX90) follow this:
• Check that VIUP (PGWM and PGWA) is in Default. If not, follow “Recover VIUP/D failed 
SWDL” under point #3 below.
• Check that HVBM is in Default.
a.  If it is not in Default, perform a 12V reset with VIDA for more than 10 minutes.
b.  If it is in Programming, perform a reload of HVBM.
• Check that HVB SOC is above 2%. If not, charge the HVB.
• If all above is okay and SWDL still fails due to Silent mode, open the VIDA diagnostic 
sequence “Disconnect main battery” and deactivate and activate HLCM converting and try 
again.
 If the issue still remains, contact RTS through a “Support Needed” vehicle report in TIE.
#3.  If SWDL failed due to the VIUP/D being partly installed (picture VIDA2_EX90) follow this:
 Check if VIUP/D is in Programming or Not responding.
a.  If VIUP/D is in Programming:
*aa. Perform a 12V reset with VIDA diagnostic sequence under “Service Function” - 
“Disconnect Main Battery” , 30 minutes.
ab.  Reload VIUP/D.
b.  If VIUP/D is not responding:
*ba. Perform a 12V reset with VIDA diagnostic sequence under “Service Function” - 
“Disconnect Main Battery” , 30 minutes. (try at least 3 times).
bb. If VIUP/D in Programming, perform a reload.
bc.  If VIUP/D is still in not responding, contact RTS through a “Support Needed” vehicle 
report in TIE.
• How to do a 12V hard reset if 12V reset with VIDA fails (step #2 & #3):
Alt a:
a1. Disconnect 12V batteries.
a2.  VIDA => Software installation => Advanced test => Reset
a3.  Connect 12V batteries after more than 10 minutes.
Alt b:
b1. Disconnect 12V batteries.
b2.  Access the VCU in the front passenger compartment and disconnect connector (see picture 
VCU1) on the VCU for more than 10 seconds.
b3.  Connect 12V batteries after more than 10 minutes.

Technical Journal 37071.4.0#4.  If there is a VIDA message “Purchase Failed - StatusCode: 502 ServerCode: 10” , (picture 
VIDA3_EX90)
 Contact RTS through a “Support Needed” vehicle report in TIE.
#5  Pairing of keyfob:
a.  Charge the keyfob on the WPC.
 If not charging, follow TJ 37030.
b.  Pairing of keyfob fails:
 Car needs to be in status Available or higher => close and reopen driver door.
c.  Pairing of keyfob fails:
 If you get message in VIDA, “ ...potential issue between key and Wireless Phone Charger...” 
(picture WPC), perform a TCAM reload, “Yes” to replace hardware.
 Then retry pairing.
d.  Keyfob pairing may be lost after SW download.
 Check keyfob pairing by removing the NFC card from the car, then enter the car with the 
keyfob and check if it’s possible to put car in D or R.
 If message “No Key found” appears - pairing is required via “Keyless vehicle key Appl” SWDL.
#6. PDS upgrade yellow message – not complete!
 After PDS is done with yellow message “ ..SW installed needs verification..” , (picture VIDA 
Yellow message), perform following steps:
1.  Click “OK” or “Cancel” on the error message.
2.  Revoke the software.
3.  Re-download the PDS.
 Check keyfob pairing again.
*#7. General VIDA warning messages:
*a.  General VIDA warning messages, example “no response HUD” (picture HUD) after PDS 
upgrade:
 If the warning message appears after PDS installation, please perform a reset of vehicle 
under Advanced Test Option in VIDA and check if the ECU is in Default, if not repeat this 
step 2 more times.
 If problems still exist, contact RTS through a “Support Needed” vehicle report in TIE.
*b. General VIDA warning message, example “Critical failure” (Picture VIDA4_EX90)
* If the warning message appears in the beginning of PDS installation follow bellow:
*aa. Check that High Voltage contactors are open. You find this under VIDA > Components 
> HVBM > Parameters > Contactor negative, status - HVBM and Contactor positive, 
status - HVBM
*ab. If contactors are closed, make sure that the car is not in usage mode “Convenience” . 
If the car is in usage mode “Convenience” , make sure that no one is in the car. (When 
someone is in the car we initiate “Convenience”)
*ac. If contactors still are closed, wait 3 minutes and check again. If still closed, turn off 
climate in CSD and wait 3 minutes. 
*ad. Try SWDL again
*ae. If problems still exist, contact RTS through a “Support Needed” vehicle report.

 If 3rd reset doesn’t set the ECUs to Default or Extended, then run VIDA “Service Function” 
- “Disconnect Main Battery” .
 If problems still exist, contact RTS through a “Support Needed” vehicle report in TIE.
*b. NFCA Not Responding.
 *If NFCA is not responding, disconnect the driver door connector for 30 seconds and then 
check under VIDA => Software installation => Advanced test if NFCA is in Default.
#9. Glove box cannot be opened.
 Follow method in VIDA IE ID: VCC-522725-2 “Emergency opening of glove box” .
#10. Window calibration after SWDL:

 By running the window(s) all the way down and then all the way up, then holding for a second, 
a manual initalization is performed and the calibration is restored.
