Case description
Due to cracking in the step area of the fairing, an updated support bracket has been introduced. The new support 
bracket will provide the better structure behind the fairing, reducing the likelihood of cracking. All new fairings will come 
with the updated support. Updated brackets are available for older fairings for additional structure support.
