under Guided Diagnostics tab – ECU Reset , wait 20 seconds and then allow a sleep cycle  and then 
perform a proxi alignment if needed .  
Then v erify the DXR app has been added to the radio  the update for the radio for this APP 
should be available as an Application Over The Air (AOTA) update in the 1st quarter of 2025. If 
U115C -00 persists, open the DXR app and accept the disclaimer. There has been some cases where 
the update is delayed from heavy network traffic and or may require an extended sleep cycle to 
complete  the update . 
For the DTC B023C -49 it will require a MIM update that should be available by the 3rd quarter 
of 2025. Do not perform service part replacements for the above concerns.
