    INTRODUCTION  Nissan is c
onducting this voluntary emission s recall campaign on certain specific model 
year 2016-2019 Titan XD vehicles with Diesel engi nes to inspect and, if necessary, replace 
the Vehicle Emission Control Information Label. Th is service will be performed at no charge 
to the customer for parts or labor.   IDENTIFICATION NUMBER  Nissan has
 assigned identificat ion number PD127 to this ca mpaign. This number must 
appear on all communication and documentation of any nature dealing with this campaign. 
  DEALER RESPONSIBILITY  It is the dealer’s resp
onsibility to check Serv ice COMM or Dealer Business Systems (DBS) 
National Service History for the campaign stat us on each vehicle falling within the range of 
this voluntary emissions recall which for any reason enters the service department. This 
includes vehicles purchased from private parties  or presented by transient (tourist) owners 
and vehicles in a dealer’s inventory.  Federal law requires that new vehicles in dealer 
inventory which are the subject of a safety recall must be corrected prior to sale.  
Failure to do so can result in civil pena lties by the National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration .  While federal law applies only to new vehicles, Nissan strongly 
encourages dealers to correct any used vehicles in  their inventory before they are retailed.
