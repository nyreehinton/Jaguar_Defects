Important: Service agents must comply with all International, Federal, State, Provincial, and/or Local laws
applicable to the activities it performs under this bulletin, including but not limited to handling, deploying,
preparing, classifying, packaging, marking, labeling, and shipping dangerous goods. In the event of a
conflict between the procedures set forth in this bulletin and the laws that apply to your dealership, you
must follow those applicable laws.
Note: There is a normal, audible noise associated with the opening/closing of the exhaust valves. The squeak/chirp
noise noting the condition is an additional, more shrill noise, and may be intermittent, influenced by temperature and
humidity.
Confirm that the front or rear/tail pipe valves are the cause of the condition by activating the flow control function of
the exhaust system.
1. Raise and support the vehicle. Refer to Lifting and Jacking the Vehicle  in SI.
2. Use GDS to verify the exhaust flow control valves open and close when commanding the Exhaust Flow Control
Valve On and Off with a scan tool.
3. For Camaro and Corvette models, the engine sound management setting must be set to “Auto” to enable the
scan tool to operate the valves.
Note: The noise may only occur during valve opening OR closing of a valve, not always both.
4. Command the flow control functioning numerous times and listen for any squeak/chirp noise, over and above
the normal activation noise.
5. If the squeak/chirp noise is evident, continue ahead to the lubrication Service Procedure below.

3. Apply DRY SLIDE Multi-Purpose Dry Lubricant, P/N 1052948 (in Canada, use 89021511), into the valve by
inserting the nozzle into the slot on the valve. Liberally apply a generous amount of the lubricant.
4340730
4. Move the drop cloth to and repeat application at both, or all four valve locations, depending on the exhaust
system.
5. With all valves lubricated, command the flow control functioning numerous times on all valves, to work the
lubricant into the valve.
6. During the flow control functioning, also verify the squeak/chirp noise has been eliminated.
