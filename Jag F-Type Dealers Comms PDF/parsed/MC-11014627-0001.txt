Correction:  
If you have a vehicle with this concern, swap the AFM rock er oil control solenoid in the
camshaft cover from side to side and reevaluate.  
If the misﬁre goes awa y or moves to the other bank, replace the AFM oil control solenoid.   
If the misﬁre remains or comes back after an AFM event or a cold start on the same
cylinder , remove that bank camshaft cover and turn the engine over by hand while closely
watching the valves on the misﬁring cylinder . 
If the cylinder was a dead misﬁre all the time and the valves open, continue with normal
misﬁre diagnosis.  
If the valves do not open(either intak e or exhaust) replace all 4 rock ers / SRFF's and all 4
SHLA's / lifters for the aﬀected cylinder .
NOTE: This PI will be updated or changed to a bulletin when engineering has decided there
is no longer a parts concern with these rock ers or a new part comes out.
