 SUBJECT: DTC P0087 / High-Pressure Fuel  
  Pump Design Change
INTRODUCTION:
This bulletin announces the design change made to the high-pressure fuel pump developed to 
prevent DTC P0087 (Fuel Rail/System Pressure – Too Low Bank 1). The performance of the internal 
discharge valve of the pump has been optimized to help prevent any unstable fuel pressure caused by 
engine vibrations. If DTC P0087 is found to be detected by the Engine Control Module (ECM), the 
high-pressure fuel pump will require replacement. 
PRODUCTION CHANGE INFORMATION:
The new high-pressure fuel pumps have been incorporated into vehicle production as per the table 
below.
