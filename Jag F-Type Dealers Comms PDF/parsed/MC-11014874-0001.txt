do the job correctly and safely. If a condition is described, DO NOT assume that this

 SUBJECT: Reprogramming Files / Crack-Type Sound   
  Emitting From Brake Booster
INTRODUCTION:
This bulletin announces availability of new Electronic Brake Booster (EBB) & Vehicle Dynamics 
Control (VDC) module reprogramming files developed to address cases of a cracking-type noise 
heard under the dashboard in the brake pedal area when the brake pedal is released. In the EBB, 
motion of the output control rod which contacts the master cylinder piston is electronically 
controlled.  If the output control rod returns too quickly when the driver releases the brake pedal, an 
excessive gap is created resulting in the cracking-type sound. This symptom may also occur when 
releasing the brake pedal after the engine restarts during Auto Start Stop activation. The new files 
contain enhanced EBB and VDC logic to synchronize the motion of the brake booster output control 
rod and master cylinder piston. If this symptom is confirmed, reprogram the EBB and VDC using the 
procedures outlined in this bulletin. 
PRODUCTION CHANGE INFORMATION:
The new EPB and VDC logic has been incorporated into vehicle production as per the table below.

SERVICE PROCEDURE / INFORMATION:
REMINDER: Customer satisfaction and retention starts with performing quality repairs. 
2024 Crosstek Non Wilderness Models ONLY:
• Replace the VDC control module with the newest part available.  
NOTE: This step will change to reprogramming in the future when the required files 
become available.  
• Reprogram the EBB Control Module following the normal SSM5-R procedure.
• Detailed information regarding the SSM5-R reprograming procedures can be found in TSB 
14-28-21R.
All Other Models:
• Reprogram the EBB &VDC Control Module following the normal SSM5-R procedure.
• Detailed information regarding the SSM5-R reprograming procedures can be found in TSB 
14-28-21R.
BATTERY CHARING INFORMATION:
Subaru of America, Inc. (SOA) highly recommends utilizing either the Subaru Midtronics DCA-
8000 Dynamic Diagnostic Charging System or the Subaru Midtronics GR8-1100 Diagnostic Battery 
Charger to the vehicle and utilizing the Power Supply Mode feature anytime a vehicle control module 
is being reprogrammed. Once the Midtronics charger is connected to the vehicle, if the battery is fully 
charged, it takes less than three (3) minutes to boot-up the charger, select the Power Supply Mode, 
and have the battery voltage stabilized and ready for reprogramming.
NOTES:
• For instructions on using the Power Supply Mode, reference the applicable User Manual for 
the Midtronics DCA-8000 Dynamic Diagnostic Charging System and the Midtronics GR8-
1100 Diagnostic Battery Charger on STIS
Bulletin Number: 06-94-25;  Date: 02/24/25         Page 3 of 4
Continued...• Confirm all electrical loads such as lights, audio, HV AC, seat heaters, and rear defroster are all 
switched OFF before setting up the charger for Power Supply Mode.
• Select the correct battery type (Enhanced Flooded, Flooded, Gel, AGM or AGM Spiral).
• Input the CCA which matches the vehicle’s battery. NOTE: OE and replacement batteries have 
different CCA ratings. Always confirm the battery’s CCA rating before proceeding.
• If using a DCA-8000 Dynamic Diagnostic Charging System, set the power supply voltage to 
13.5 V olts.
• DO NOT connect the DST-i or DST-010 until the Power Supply mode function has completed 
its battery test mode and the Charging V oltage has dropped to and shows a steady 13.5 V olts on 
the display.
• Once Power Supply Mode reaches a steady 13.5 V olts, connect the DST-i or DST-010 to the 
OBD connector and proceed with initiating the normal SSM5-R reprogramming process.
• Amperage will fluctuate based upon the vehicle’s demand for power. NOTE: If the voltage 
rises beyond 14 V olts while programming is in process, the procedure will abort. This can 
indicate a need to test or charge the vehicle battery before any further attempt at programming 
is made.
• ALWAYS set the power supply voltage to 13.5 V olts when using Power Supply Mode. NEVER 
turn the ignition switch on when charging at voltages 15 V olts or higher.
REMINDER: If the DCA-8000 or GR8-1100 indicates the vehicle’s battery must be charged, charge 
the battery fully before proceeding to reprogram the vehicle while using the Power Supply Mode.
NOTE: Control module failures resulting from battery discharge during reprogramming are not a 
matter for warranty. Should any DTCs reset after the reprogramming update is performed, diagnose 
per the procedure outlined in the applicable Service Manual.
WARRANTY / CLAIM INFORMATION:

IMPORTANT: Always note the original Calibration Identification number (CID) / ROMID the 
vehicle came in with on the repair order before reprogramming and, make sure to list the NEW CID / 
ROMID for any newly installed programming (as confirmed from the actual control module AFTER 
installation). The NEW CID / ROMID MUST also be noted on the repair order as this information is 
required for entry in the Miscellaneous Detail field during claim submission. These numbers can be 
read using SSM5-R. 
NOTE: The pfc file listings provided in this bulletin are the latest available at the time of publishing. 
Updates are often released thereafter without revision to the original bulletin. For this reason, it is 
critical to always have the latest version of Select Monitor software installed on your system. You 
can confirm if a later version is available by entering the CID listed in this bulletin into SSM5-R. If a 
newer CID is shown as available in SSM5-R, reprogram using that file.

• SOA strongly discourages the printing and/or local storage of service information as previously 
released information and electronic publications may be updated at any time.
• Always check for any open recalls or campaigns anytime a vehicle is in for servicing.
• Always refer to STIS for the latest service information before performing any repairs.
