Introduction  
Some 2018  – 2025 model year Lexus vehicles equipped with the Enform™ 2.0 Navigation 
System, require a Special Service Tool (SST) USB flash drive to update the map, points of 
interest, and system software. The SST is used with applicable vehicles to deliver the update, 
however, the process for generating license keys differs from previous generations.  
 
Before attempting to perform a map update, the expiration date of the dynamic subscription 
(stored in the head unit), must be checked. If the expiration date has not passed, a license key 
may be generated without the purchase of an activation card number (ACN). Updating the map 
without the use of an ACN is considered an Embedded Navigation Update (refer to pg.  11) and 
performing this update does not exte nd the subscription to dynamic map services. If the 
subscription period has expired, or is expiring within the next 90 days, it should be recommended 
to the customer to purchase an ACN. Utilizing an ACN, will initiate the Dynamic Navigation Update 
(refer t o pg.  4). This Dynamic Navigation Update will perform the embedded navigation update and 
provide dynamic map services for a period of two years from the date that the Dynamic Navigation 
Update is performed.  
 
ACNs are provided in a pa mphlet available through the normal parts ordering system. Follow the 
process in this bulletin to perform the update.  
 
 
 
  NOTE  
Map data is released once each year through the shipment of an SST USB flash drive to each dealer. 
The SST MUST be stored in the SST cabinet to ensure it can be easily found.  SUPERSESSION  NOTICE  
The information  contained  in this bulletin  supersedes  Service Bulletin  No. L-SB-0043-20. 
 Applicability has been updated to include 2021 – 2022 model year Lexus vehicles.  
 The Introduction section has been updated.  
Service Bulletin No. L-SB-0043-20 is obsolete, and any printed versions should be discarded .
