ConditionEngineering is currently investigating causes for P0D22
that may not be related to hardware failures with the
T18 Battery Charger . 
The PI will be updated or replace with a TSB once a
determination has been made. 
The concerns under investigation at this time happen
speciﬁcally when charging using level 2 charge
equipment. 
Aﬀected vehicles ma y experience a MIL with P0D22 set
as current or history at the time the vehicle is being
diagnosed.
The customer ma y also notice the vehicle fails to
charge, the MIL comes on after a charge event has
concluded or once the T arget Charge Level (TCL) has
been reached.
 
CauseThe cause of these conditions ma y be related to
software anomalies.

Correction:  
If an aﬀected vehicle presents with this DTC or these symptoms, reprogram the
K16 Battery Energy Control Module (BECM). 
If one of these conditions persists after reprogramming, the condition was not
corrected by the suspected software concern in the BECM engineering is
investigating.
Follow SI Diagnostic procedures for the DTC or symptom that remains after
reprogramming and repair the vehicle according to SI. 
P0D22 Diagnostic Information
While the possible software concerns under investigation occur with level 2
charging only , here is some other information that ma y be useful during P0D22
troubleshooting and testing.
 
General Diagnostic Information
P0D22 sets when diﬀerence between the AC Input Current and the
commanded current value from the battery energy control module is
greater than 4 A for 10 seconds. 
P0D22 diagnostics can run while level 1 charging (110 V AC) or level 2
charging (240 V AC)
P0D22 diagnostics do not run when DC fast charging.
P0D22 diagnostics can also run while the charger is being used in "W all
power" mode.
 
Level 1 and 2 AC Charging Diagnostic Information
When the vehicle is connected to any form of EVSE (Electric V ehicle Supply
Equipment) that provides level 1 or level 2 charging for the HV battery ,
diagnostics for P0D22 can run if the conditions for running the DTC in SI
are met. 
Usually level 1 chargers are connected to a 110 V AC outlet. (example: an
outlet you would use to charge your phone)
Usually level 2 chargers are connected to a 240 V AC outlet. (example: an
outlet you would use to plug in an oven or dryer)
Both types of AC chargers can be portable or built-in.
When portable, there is usually a swappable plug that allows the
equipment to change between level 1 and level 2 charging. 
Most consumer level charge equipment that is permanently installed is a
level 2 charger
 
"Wall power" Diagnostic Information
When a vehicle is plugged into a wall charger but does not require HV
battery charging, the energy from the wall charger can be used to support
certain vehicle systems lik e the HV AC, battery pack heater , etc.
This is done to increase occupant comfort and vehicle readiness without
depleting EV range. 
Note- If a customer experiences this failure, they will usually report
that the MIL is on after charging the vehicle for an extended period,
but the State of Charge (SOC) matches what they have programmed
for their TCL.
 
If you wish to mak e a charger operate in this wa y for testing or diagnostics, you
can perform these steps:
1. Check the HV battery SOC percentage on the vehicle
2. Make note of its current level.
3. Using the infotainment displa y (see the vehicle owners manual) set the TCL
to a level below your current SOC.
