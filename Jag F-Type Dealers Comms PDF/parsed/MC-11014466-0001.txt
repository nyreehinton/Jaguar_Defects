Correction:  
Allow the vehicle to sit several hours or overnight in cold outside temperatures (32
degrees or colder).  
Drive the vehicle slowly making sharp turns in an attempt to duplicate the concern.   
If the concern is duplicated inspect the drive axles and boots for any damage and repair as
necessary . 
If no damage is noted to drive axles do not attempt any repairs.  
Advise the customer that the vehicle is safe to drive and that Engineering is currently
investigating . 
The PI will be updated or replaced with TSB once a determination has been made.
