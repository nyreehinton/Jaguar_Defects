Correction:  
Engineering is currently investigating the issue, but in the meantime
follow normal SI diagnostics.  It has been noticed that this condition is more
prevalent in colder ambient temperate and a lower battery state of charge
maybe a contributing factor .  If after following SI diagnostics and a root cause
is not found, then perform the following inspections:
1.  Test the battery using the GR8/DCBS and replace as necessary .  
NOTE:  T esting the battery at the ambient temperatures the issue occurs could
help identify any battery related issues.  
2.  Inspect the battery cables and battery fuse block connections to mak e sure
they are clean and tight.
3.  If applicable, perform  PIT6260  Dead Battery / Excessive Battery Draw Drain
Parasitic / Low Battery V oltage / Reprogram BCM.   
4.  Inspect for any type of aftermark et equipment that could draw down the
battery (dash cameras, cell phone chargers, etc.).
