The model(s) and model year(s) listed are a general approximation of the affected VIN list. Refer to the VIN/Bulletin Tracker or Customer/Vehicle profile to determine 
applicability of this bulletin for a particular vehicle.  
Campaign Bulletin: This campaign bulletin addresses a non -safety -related condition and provides recommended technical 
diagnosis and repair procedures. Apply this procedure to the applicable vehicles.  
Condition  
Some  Model S and Model X vehicles  with revision D interior cameras might suffer from lower -than-expected  
navigation signal strength  under certain circumstances . 
Correction  
Perform USB device troubleshooting to determine whether  aftermarket USB devices are interfer ing with navigation  
signals . If necessary, replace the interior camera with an updated part . Perform extended Global Navigation Satellite 
System ( GNSS ) diagnostics on the vehicle  if the initial remedies are ineffective.

Check for Aftermarket USB Devices  
Check the center console and glove box for any aftermarket USB devices that are being stored. Also check whether 
aftermarket USB devices are plugged into the center console and glove box USB ports (Figures 1 –3).  
 NOTE : Tesla USB devices, such as the Tesla USB drive  (Figure 4)  or Tesla Solid State Drive  (Figure 5) , have 
minimal effect on GNSS performance and can be ignored.

• If aftermarket USB device(s) are plugged into the center console USB ports, or if there are disconnected 
aftermarket USB devices stored in the center console or glove box, perform “ Prepare for Troubleshooting ”, 
and then continue  to the “Troubleshoot USB Devices ” section.  
• If no aftermarket USB devices are plugged into the center console and glove box USB ports, and there are no 
disconnected aftermarket USB devices stored inside of the center console and glove box, USB devices are 
not currently affecting navigation performan ce on this vehicle . Perform  “Prepare for Troubleshooting ”, and 
then skip to the “Troubleshoot Interior Camera ” section.

Prepare for Troubleshooting  
1. Under a clear sky, park the vehicle where the view of the sky is unobstructed by tall structures such as buildings 
or trees.  
 NOTE: Bring a plastic trim tool, as it might be needed later in this procedure.  
2. Plug all the customer’s USB device(s) into the center console USB port(s).  
 NOTE : Use only the customer’s USB devices. Do not troubleshoot with USB devices that were not found in 
the customer’s vehicle.  
3. Enable Service Mode (refer to Service Manual procedure 00050100; Model S , Model X ). 
4. In the Service Mode menu, touch Driver Assist  > Cameras . 
Troubleshoot USB Devices  
The instructions in this section determine whether the customer’s aftermarket USB device(s) are emitting 
electromagnetic energy that is negatively impacting navigation signal reception strength.   
In the  “Carrier/Noise” section of the  “GNSS” panel, monitor the GPS, BeiDou, and Galileo signal strength readings 
(Figure 6). 
 
Figure 6 
• If the GPS, BeiDou, and Galileo signal strength readings are all “40” or greater,  the condition described by this 
bulletin is not the issue. Use correction code S022517004, and then continue diagnosis  if necessary .  
• If any of the GPS, BeiDou , or Galileo signal strength readings are less than “40”, disconnect the USB 
device(s) from the vehicle  while  continuing to monitor the GNSS signal strength readings.  
o If the GPS, BeiDou, and Galileo signal strength readings are all “40” or greater  after disconnecting the 
USB device (s), discontinue this procedure and use correction code S032517004 . 
 NOTE: Upon return of the vehicle to the customer, inform them that Tesla confirmed that the USB 
device(s) used in the vehicle were interfering with vehicle navigation signal reception . Advise them to 
disconnect the device(s) when using navigation or Autopilot features  if they wish to avoid performance 
issues with those features . 
o If any of the GPS, BeiDou, or Galileo  signal strength readings are still less than “40”, continue  to the 
“Troubleshoot  Interior Camera ” section .

Troubleshoot Interior Camera  
1. Release the rear view mirror upper cover from the windshield (refer to Service Manual procedure 15051802; 
Model S , Model X ).  
 NOTE: Do not disconnect any electrical harnesses at this time.  
2. While monitoring the GNSS signal strength readings (Figure 6), disconnect the electrical harness from the interior 
camera (Figure 7). 
 
Figure 7 
• If the GPS, BeiDou , and Galileo signal strength readings are all “40” or greater after disconnecting the interior 
camera harness,  skip to the “ Replace Interior Camera ” section.  
• If any of the GPS, BeiDou, or Galileo signal strength readings are still less than “40”, extended GNSS 
diagnostics is required. Perform the following:  
a. Replace the interior camera with an updated part (see parts table on page 1) (refer to Service Manual 
procedure 17241602; Model S , Model X ). 
b. Use correction code S042517004  or S0 52517004 .  
c. Refer to Toolbox article 7032500  to perform extended GNSS diagnostics. Track any additional work in a 
separate service activity, using correction code 00100004 .  
d. Discontinue this procedure.  
Replace Interior Camera  
A newer version of the interior camera is available . This updated part emits less electromagnetic energy  and may 
improve vehicle navigation signal strength. Perform the following steps:  
1. Replace the interior camera with an updated part (see parts table on page 1) (refer to Service Manual procedure 
17241602; Model S , Model X ). 
 NOTE: Replace the camera  even if GNSS signal strength readings have not been tested.  
2. Use correction code S042517004  or S05 2517004 , and then d iscontinue this procedure . 
 NOTE : Inform the customer that aftermarket USB devices may interfere with vehicle navigation signal 
reception. Advise them that disconnecting their device(s) may be necessary when using navigation or Autopilot 
features  if they wish to avoid performance issues with those features .
