Manual Park Brake Handle . Title:  
 
Park Brake Valve Handle

Introduction:   
 
This Service Bulletin has been released to remind Operators  of the correct operation of the park brake 
lever following a recent  increase in reported failures  of these valves .  
 
  
 
The outcome of our investigation has led to the conclusion that misuse of the lever is the cause of the 
failures, rather than a fault with the valve . 
 The apparent misuse is caused when drivers are allowing the lever of the parking brake to fly back 
under the full force of the return spring against the stop . This leads to fatigue in the material of the 
park brake valve handle and its premature failure.  
 
 
Instructions for C orrect  Use: 
 
To release the parking brake, the sleeve on the lever must first be lifted , then the lever guided fully 
forward in a controlled manner . 
 
 
CAUTION: Do not release the lever so that it will be released under the full force of the return 
spring. This repeated action may cause damage to the park brake valve.
