DESCRIPTION:
Note! This Technical Journal is only valid for vehicles equipped with Android Automotive Operating 
System.
If the customer complains of the Volvo Cars app sending push notifications from a previously paired 
vehicle, and having an unpaired vehicle in the Garage - Profile tab (see attachment TJ 37179.jpg), 
then follow the advice under Service.
This may occur if a user:
• Just uninstalled the app from a device without unpairing the device - relation remains in cloud.
• Installs the app again on a different device - the vehicle will be shown as “incomplete pairing” in 
the app.
If a push notification is generated, it will be sent to all user devices including “incomplete pairings” .
See information and inform customer how to remove the Volvo Cars app in Volvocars.com/support/
Volvo Cars app/Getting started/Removing a car in the Volvo Cars app.
