Condition  
On some  Model Y vehicles,  the center high mounted stop light may cause interference with the  power supply line for 
the High Voltage Controller (HVC),  which can falsely trigger  High Voltage Interlock Loop (HVIL ) alerts 
HVP_w026_HvilFault  or BMS_a036_SW_HvpHvilFault . 
Correction  
Inspect the vehicle for symptoms related to the condition. If symptoms are present, add a ferrite to the HVC electrical 
harness.

7. Apply electrical tape onto the HVC electrical harness branch on both sides of the ferrite, making sure to cover the 
ferrite, the ferrite casing and the  harness (Figure 7).  
 NOTE:  Apply sufficient tape and position the ferrite to rest on the vehicle body to prevent NVH issues . Apply 
an extra layer of tape if necessary.
