Introduction  
During  the manufacturing  process , tires are mounted  on the vehicle  as matched  sets to help reduce  
conditions  such  as pulling  or drifting.  If the wheels  are replaced  or refinished  before  vehicle  delivery,  
it is important that  the tires  remain on  the vehicle in the  same location  and in the  same direction  
of rotation.  
 
Refer  to the Tire Positioning P rocedure  in this bulletin  to ensure that the original tires stay in the 
same location  on the vehicle.
