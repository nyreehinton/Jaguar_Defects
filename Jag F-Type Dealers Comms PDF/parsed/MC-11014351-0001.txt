Warning  
•Exposure to high voltages from a large modules or packs can cause shock,   
burns or even death.  
•The high voltage components in a large module or pack can only be serviced by 
technicians with special high voltage training.  
• Follow all necessary precautions before working on them.  
• Always assume voltage is present on high voltage  
cables until you have verified voltage has been removed.  
 
Equipment Calibration  
All test equipment must be within their calibration interval and recorded such with the respective serial numbers. 
These records must be available to the Checker.  
 
Personnel Requirement  
Only trained personnel shall supervise and perform High Voltage system rework , and troubleshooting. Two 
personnel shall perform rework  Procedures, together, to ensure safety of themselves, others nearby & for the 
protection of vehicle & property. Refresher training shall be provided to these personnel on a regular basis and 
when new systems are to be checked by them. The training of the personnel shall consist of:  
HV & low voltage basics, intermediate & advanced electricity  
HV & low voltage electrical systems of the vehicle  
Shop safety practices & procedures  
First aide including CPR & the use of the shop defibrillator  
How to release a victim that can’t let go HV  
Quickest method of shutting down HV  
Firefighting and emergency procedures  
HV & arc flash safety  
Organized & tidy placement of equipment & tools allowing for  unrestricted movement  
Operation of Hi -pot 
 
To ensure effectiveness of training, exams of the trained material shall be required with a high passing mark of at 
least 80% and a retraining of the missed 20 % on a one-to-one basis.  
 
(Caution: The employee completing the rework  must not have any health conditions that can be exacerbated 
when startled and must not have any electronic implants.)

Vehicle Inspection  
It is necessary that the vehicle to be reworked , first be visually inspected of all systems, workmanship and with 
special attention to ensuring there is no HV cable or equipment damage or chafing.  
 
High Voltage Rework Preparation  
(1) Install Safety barricade with warning lights & signs indicating "Danger High Voltage" around the vehicle 
perimeter and ensure no personnel are within the fenced perimeter during the  rework  procedure.  
(2) It shall always be the goal to check the systems as much as possible with all HV power OFF and Locked 
Out/Tagged Out and proven as de -energized by voltage measurement using the DMM. The functionality of the 
DMM must be proved before and after the verific ation of no HV present. Then, if possible, the HV systems should 
be challenged by trying to energize them while checking that no  HV appears.  
(3) When it is necessary to perform tests of HV systems with the power ON, then the Working Live procedure 
must be followed.  
(4) The test personnel shall always rehearse the actions required in case of any possible accident scenarios.  
(5) Before beginning the rework  Procedure, the test personnel shall remove all their jewelry (including pierced 
ones), watches and any electrically conductive objects on them.  
 
PPE Requirements  
The PPE voltage class, Arc Flash and Arc Blast rating shall be compatible with the voltage and Arc Flash 
capability of the systems being tested. Appropriate leather glove protectors shall be worn over the HV rubber 
gloves.  
 
PPE Care & Testing  
Rubber insulated PPE shall be periodically cleaned and tested in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.137 and the 
appropriate ANSI/ASTM standards. HV gloves, sleeves and mats shall be tested every 6 months. PPE apparel 
shall be cleaned and maintained in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. A record of the PPE testing 
shall be maintained and available to the users.  
 
 
PPE Inspection  
Inspect PPE equipment, before use, for any degradation or damage and ensure that the HV gloves have been 
tested every 6 months. Also perform an air pressure test on the HV gloves before and after each use. If during 
PPE use a potential damaging incident oc curred to the PPE, stop further testing and inspect the PPE. If at any 
time the PPE is defective, reject it, and obtain an accepted one.  
 
PPE Storage  
PPE apparel should be stored lying flat, undistorted, right -side out and not folded in protective containers. The HV 
mats can be rolled with an inside diameter greater than 2 inches.  
Rubber HV gloves should be stored in cool, dark, dry, and free from damaging chemicals or vapors. The glove 
cuffs should face downwards, without folding, in the appropriate glove bag and hung vertically.  
 
 
Insulated Tools  
Insulated tools should be visually inspected for insulation damage before and after each session of use.

ITS-61261 Page 4 02/05/2025 
 
 
Lockout/Tagout Procedure  
The Lockout/Tagout procedure should be followed that is specified in the respective rework  procedure. When 
removing the lock and tag:  
(1) The locks and tags shall be removed by the installer of them or under her/his supervision.  
(2) If the installer of the locks and tags is not available, then her/his supervisor:  
(a) Ensures that the installer of the locks and tags in not in the facility  
(b) Contacts the installer to inform her/him that the locks and tags will be removed  
(c) Reminds the installer of the lock and tag removal when she/he resumes work  
 
Stored Energy  
Personnel must always remember the characteristics of stored energy devices such as capacitors and batteries 
and when energy is available from.  
 
Working Live  
To maximize safety, it is always important to perform the maximum amount of HV rework  in the de -energized 
state.  
When it is necessary to work with HV equipment while energized or to verify whether HV is present, the utmost 
care and safety procedures must be utilized including:  
(1) Wearing appropriate PPE with protector gloves over top of the HV rubber gloves  
(2) Ensure all personnel, except the Checker and Monitor/Recorder, are clear of the vehicle  
(3) Kneeling or standing on HV insulated mat  
 
Energizing & De -energizing Procedure  
It is critical that before any HV system is energized that a visual check be performed to ensure that all possible HV 
compartments are closed and there is no debris, tools or test equipment lying on HV terminations.  
If there is a  certain sequence of energizing and de -energizing the HV system, then all personnel involved must be 
trained in this sequence. (CAUTION: Never try to connect or disconnect circuit components such as cables, fuses, 
connectors, etc. while there is current flo wing in the circuit.)  
Electrical Injuries  
Electrical injuries should be immediately reported to the first aide personnel and the supervisor. Other than 
electrostatic shocks, even non -injurious electrical shocks should be reported to the supervisor. These should be 
immediately investigated and docu mented to determine the cause and prevent the occurrence in the future.

Juice Box ESS Enclosure Removal Beam  
CAUTION: It is important that technicians involved in hoisting and rigging are trained in both safety and 
operation procedures. Hoisting equipment should only be operated by trained personnel. Do not use 
equipment that is suspected to be unsafe or unsuitable, until  a competent person has verified its 
suitability. The rated working load limits apply only to equipment and hardware in good condition. Any 
equipment damaged in service should be taken out of service and repaired or destroyed.  
CAUTION: Do not attempt to lift the ESS enclosure without the gasket and lid attached and all fasteners 
applied and properly torqued.  
  NOTE:  It is strongly recommended to use a JB removal beam (NF PN: 6485763) with a forklift adapter 
boom (NF PN: 6485514) to lift the ESS assembly to ensure safe load distribution and avoid damage to the 
fiberglass lid. Minimum requirement for safe lifting is to use a spreader beam and is also acceptable. S ee 
Illustration below  for reference.  
  NOTE:  Lifting device securement straps should be connected at no less tha n 60 degrees as shown 
below to prevent strap damage to the ESS enclosure or connected to a lifting device wider than the ESS 
unit being removed in a vertical position as shown below to prevent strap damage to the ESS enclosure.
