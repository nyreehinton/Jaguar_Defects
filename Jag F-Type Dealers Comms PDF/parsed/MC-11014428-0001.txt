Illuminated MIL With DTCs P0300 And P0316
Some 2024-2025 Escape and 2025 Bronco Sport vehicles equipped with a 1.5L EcoBoost engine may exhibit
an illuminated malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) with only diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) P0300 and P0316
stored in the powertrain control module (PCM). This concern typically happens after initial engine start up
following an overnight cold soak. This may be due to the software in the PCM and replacement or
reprogramming of the PCM will not resolve this condition. This condition does not affect vehicle durability and
no additional diagnosis or service is required for this condition at this time. Inform customers that they can
continue to drive the vehicle and engineering is currently working on a solution for this condition that is
expected in Q2 2025. Monitor Professional Technician System (PTS) for additional information and schedule
service appointments for customers once the repair becomes available.
