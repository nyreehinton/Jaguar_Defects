SERVICE:
SiriusXM Satellite Radio is not available for MY25 EX30.
• Customers are advised to use the SiriusXM App via Apple CarPlay.
• Customers using SiriusXM on the phone will procure a subscription directly from SiriusXM and 
whatever trial offers they are providing at that time. There is no three-month trial associated with 
the purchase of an EX30.
• There is an ongoing conversation between SiriusXM and Volvo Cars about an app based solution 
for the vehicle, but there is no timeline for adoption. If such an app becomes available a bulletin 
will be released.
