The original calibration in the TCM of certain 2025MY N -Gas vehicles contained incorrect 
logic that may unnecessarily cause DTC P175E to set and illuminate the Check Engine 
Malfunction Indicator  Light  (MIL) .  An updated TCM calibration correcting this concern is 
now available.  Additionally, the Transmission Fast Learn must be completed after the 
TCM calibration is completed.  
Dealers are to reprogram the TCM with a corrected service calibration  and perform the 
Transmission Fast Learn .  Follow the service procedure below to update the TCM 
calibration and perform the Transmission Fast Learn  as required . 
 
1. Block the wheels and apply the parking brake.
