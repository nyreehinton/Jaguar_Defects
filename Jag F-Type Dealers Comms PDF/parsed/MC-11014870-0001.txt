SERVICE PROCEDURE / INFORMATION:
STEP 1: Confirm	the	customer	concern	is	 with the applicable head unit resulting in a black or blank 
screen, a loss of audio, repeated rebooting, or/and inability to use one of the following features: 
CarPlay/Android Auto, Navigation, Bluetooth, or touch screen operation. The extension does NOT 
cover issues caused by physical damage such as water damage or screen impact.
STEP 2: Check the head unit software status. If new software is available, reprogram the head unit 
using the latest software available. For details regarding head unit reprogramming refer to TSB 15-
236-18 for Harman Gen3.1 or TSBs: 15-261-20 or 15-297-22 or 15-301-22 for Denso CP1 or TSB

STEP 3: (ONLY required if the current software is the newest available or reprogramming

unchanged. Always refer to the applicable Service Manual and review the full requirements of the 
repair being performed. The Service Manual procedures contain information critical to performing 
an	effective	repair	the	first	time,	every	time.	 This	includes	but	is	not	limited	to	important	SAFETY 	
precautions, proper inspection criteria, necessary special tools, required processes and related one-
time-use parts needed for a complete and lasting repair.
