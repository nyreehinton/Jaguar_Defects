ConditionSome customers ma y comment of a hum, buzz, or vibration type
noise coming from the HV AC when the mode is set to the defrost
or ﬂoor positions along with higher blower speeds and higher
temperature settings.  If the HV AC mode is changed to include
the instrument panel dash vents the noise will be gone.

dash vent door seals (2) vibrating against the HV AC case, shown
below .  This concern only happens when the HV AC instrument
panel dash vent doors (2)  are in the closed position along with
the HV AC set to a higher temperature and blower speed.

Correction:  
Apply ﬂocking tape (3) to the forward edge of each HV AC instrument panel dash vent duct
openings (1) at the door sealing surface (4) where the forward edge of the door contacts
the HV AC case.  
 
-  Before any disassembly use the HV AC controls to set the mode to the full
instrument panel dash vent position, this will open the instrument panel
dash vent doors to allow the installation of the ﬂocking tape. 
Important: Do not attempt to remove the brack et from the bottom of the passenger's
airbag.  This brack et has non-serviceable fasteners.  Attempting to remove them will
damage the passenger's side airbag module.  T o enable removal of the I/P trim with the
airbag module, it ma y help to remove some fasteners from the I/P structure to allow the
right side of the structure to be moved out of the wa y.  This will allow the passenger's
airbag and I/P trim to be removed more easily .
-  Next, access the left and right instrument panel outer and center air outlet
ducts, which in most cases can be done by following SI procedure for
"Instrument P anel Upper T rim P anel Removal and Installation".
-  When applying the ﬂocking tape, it should be cut to ﬁt the duct opening and in most
cases about 15mm will need to be trimmed oﬀ the end of each strip before it is installed. 
-  The tape should be applied to the forward edge of the port with about half of the tape
width positioned in the door sealing/contact area and then wrap the remaining tape width
up into the port opening, as shown (4).  Use an alcohol wipe to clean the HV AC case where
