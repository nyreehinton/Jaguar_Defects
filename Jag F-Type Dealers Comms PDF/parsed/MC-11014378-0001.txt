must follow those applicable laws.
 
Service Procedure
Note: Using Woven Polyester Electrical Tape (PET), tape all the contact points of the wiring harness ensuring
that the tape is applied in a double layer extending along the harness past the splice sleeves. Verify all straps are
secured and retainers are installed.

Information
Area of Concern at the CAC Pump Electrical Connector
6219342
An open cavity or an unsealed pump connector allowing water into the (M10) charge air cooler pump electrical
connector might be the root cause of the communication failure.
- Check the CAC Pump connector sealing and look for any corrosion at the pump due to water leakage.
DTCs that may be common with water intrusion the electrical connector:
Note: U02A9 might be set with or without U1345 (LIN BUS1 Failure).

Area of Concern Active Grille Air Shutter Actuator In-line Connector
The following DTCs may be caused by the engine wiring harness to active grille air shutter actuator in-line connector
(X618 on the pickup and X604A 0n the SUV). Please check circuit 4621 which may be:
• Not properly connected
Page 4 February, 2025 Bulletin No.: 23-NA-102
• Not properly held by the rear clip
• Grounded on the radiator
6219339
The graphic above shows how the proper connection must be.
- Check the active grille air shutter actuator in-line connector for not being properly connected or grounded to the
radiator.
DTCs may be caused by the active grill air shutter wiring pinched at the radiator support.
6219340
The graphic above depicts where a pinching condition may be located.
- Check the active grill air shutter wiring route to identify possible damaged points in the wiring.
DTCs that may be common with the wiring harness contacting the radiator or an improper connection:
• P0700 Transmission Control Module Requested Malfunction Indicator Lamp Illumination
• P25A2 Brake System Control Module Requested Malfunction Indicator Lamp Illumination
• U0284 Lost Communication with Active Grille Air Shutter Actuator 1
