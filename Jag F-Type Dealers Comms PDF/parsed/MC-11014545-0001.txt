1 / 8Affected Models:   2014 - 2022 UH200/A (Burgman 200/200 ABS) 
Affected Departments:   Management, Service, Sales, Warranty , Parts, Accessories
Attachment:    Customer Letter ( warranty extension announcement )
Reference:    Burgman 200/200 ABS Service Manual ( 99500-31523-03E )
Suzuki Motor Corporation (SMC) is announcing a ten-year warranty repair coverage on the fuel pumps of 2014 
– 2022 Burgman 200/200 ABS scooters. Normally, the warranty repair coverage period for the Burgman 200/200 ABS scooter is one-year.
What is the problem?
It has been determined that operating or storing a Burgman 200/200 ABS scooter in an area where salt water from certain atmospheric phenomena may accumulate onto the fuel pump, the fuel pump discharge port resin material may deteriorate from extended contact with compounds present in the salt water. This deterioration, combined with bending stress from the fuel pump outlet hose, can cause micro-cracks to form in the discharge port resin material. In the worst case over time, the micro-cracks may enlarge into a larger crack that passes completely through the fuel pump discharge port structure. In this case, fuel leakage can occur from the crack.
What is Suzuki doing to solve the problem:
To ensure customer satisfaction, SMC has decided to extend the warranty period for the fuel pump on the 2014 – 2022 Burgman 200/200 ABS (UH200/A L4 - M2). The extension will provide warranty coverage for 
a pump-related leak for ten years (unlimited mileage), starting on the original date of purchase. A new rubber protective cover has been developed, that combined with a new fuel pump assembly, a new fuel hose, and other related parts, will help resolve the salt water-related fuel leak.
What Suzuki Motor USA, LLC (Suzuki) will do:
Beginning the week of February 10, 2025, Suzuki will mail notification letters to owners of potentially affected scooters for whom we have information (see pages 7 and 8 of this bulletin). This letter informs customers of the 
fuel pump warranty extension and instructs them to contact a Suzuki dealer if a fuel leak occurs to schedule an appointment to diagnose and repair the fuel leak.  
What your Suzuki dealership will do:
Before performing a fuel pump repair on a scooter, first verify the repair needs to be performed by diagnosing the cause of the fuel leak. Use the Vehicle Master Inquiry function on Suzuki CONNECT to determine the original date of sale to verify warranty coverage for the repair. Then order the required parts as listed on page 2 of this 
bulletin and perform the repair as recommended on pages 4 - 6.  After repair completion, return the scooter to 
the customer and submit a warranty claim as listed on page 3 .
If you have a question regarding fuel pump warranty repair eligibility or a technical concern, contact TECH-LINE at (714) 996-7480 or call your Suzuki Technical Service & Parts Manager (TSPM).GV/AN/UH No. 059
