Bendix® TABS‑8™ Advanced Single‑Channel Trailer Antilock  
Braking System (ABS) Module
1. INTRODUCTION
The Bendix® TABS‑8™ Advanced Module is an integrated 
single‑channel (2S/1M) trailer service brake module 
controller for air‑braked, heavy‑duty semi‑trailers that 
features the Bendix® Antilock Braking System (ABS) and 
the Bendix® Trailer Roll Stability Program (TRSP®).
Installed on semi‑trailers, the TABS‑8 Advanced Module 
acts as a relay valve during normal braking, but during ABS 
events, it will intervene to help maintain vehicle stability and 
minimize stopping distance by preventing wheel lock‑up. 
The TRSP monitors the trailer’s motion and reduces the 
risk of rollovers by automatically applying the brakes when 
a risk of rollover is detected.

WARNING! PLEASE READ AND
FOLLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS
TO AVOID PERSONAL INJURY OR DEATH:
When working on or around a vehicle, the following 
guidelines should be observed AT ALL TIMES :
 ▲Park the vehicle on a level surface, apply the parking 
brakes and always block the wheels.  Always wear personal 
protection equipment.  
 ▲Stop the engine and remove the ignition key when working 
under or around the vehicle.  When working in the engine 
compartment, the engine should be shut off   and the ignition 
key should be removed. Where circumstances require that 
the engine be in operation, EXTREME CAUTION  should be 
used to prevent personal injury resulting from contact with 
moving, rotating, leaking, heated or electrically‑charged 
components.  
 ▲Do not attempt to install, remove, disassemble or 
assemble a component until you have read, and thoroughly 
understand, the recommended procedures.  Use only the 
proper tools and observe all precautions pertaining to use 
of those tools.
 ▲If the work is being performed on the vehicle’s air brake 
system, or any auxiliary pressurized air systems, make 
certain to drain the air pressure from all reservoirs before 
beginning ANY  work on the vehicle.  If the vehicle is 
equipped with a Bendix® AD‑IS® air dryer system, a Bendix® 
DRM™ dryer reservoir module, a Bendix® AD‑9si®, AD‑HF®, 
or AD‑HFi® air dryer, be sure to drain the purge reservoir.
 ▲ Following the vehicle manufacturer’s recommended 
procedures, deactivate the electrical system in a manner 
that safely removes all electrical power from the vehicle .
 ▲Never exceed manufacturer’s recommended pressures.  
 ▲Never connect or disconnect a hose or line containing 
pressure; it may whip and/or cause hazardous airborne 
dust and dirt particles. Wear eye protection. Slowly open 
connections with care, and verify that no pressure is 
present. Never remove a component or plug unless you are 
certain all system pressure has been depleted.
 ▲ Use only genuine Bendix® brand replacement parts, 
components and kits. Replacement hardware, tubing, hose, 
fi  ttings, wiring, etc. must be of equivalent size, type and 
strength as original equipment and be designed specifi  cally 
for such applications and systems.
 ▲Components with stripped threads or damaged parts should 
be replaced rather than repaired.  Do not attempt repairs 
requiring machining or welding unless specifi  cally stated 
and approved by the vehicle and component manufacturer.
 ▲Prior to returning the vehicle to service, make certain all 
components and systems are restored to their proper 
operating condition.
 ▲ For vehicles with Automatic Traction Control (ATC), the ATC 
function must be disabled (ATC indicator lamp should be 
ON) prior to performing any vehicle maintenance where 
one or more wheels on a drive axle are lifted off   the ground 
and moving.
 ▲The power MUST be temporarily disconnected from the 
radar sensor whenever any tests USING A DYNAMOMETER 
are conducted on a vehicle equipped with a Bendix® 
Wingman® system.
 ▲You should consult the vehicle manufacturer's operating 
and service manuals, and any related literature, in 
conjunction with the Guidelines above. 
Disconnect the electrical connectors from the Antilock 
Braking System (ABS)/Bendix® Trailer Roll Stability 
Program (TRSP®) controller before welding on the 
trailer.
 
Dielectric grease should be applied to electrical 
connectors to help protect against moisture intrusion.
 
Bendix®‑brand Electronic Control Units (ECUs) are 
not designed to store data for purposes of accident 
reconstruction, and Bendix® ACom® Diagnostic 
Software is not intended to retrieve data for purposes 
of accident reconstruction. Bendix makes no 
representations as to the accuracy of data or video 
retrieved and interpreted from ECUs for purposes 
of accident reconstruction. Bendix does not offer 
accident reconstruction services or interpretation of 
stored data. Bendix ECUs are not protected from fire, 
loss of power, impact damage, or other conditions that 
may be sustained in a crash situation and may cause 
data to be unavailable or irretrievable.
43.  ANTILOCK BRAKING SYSTEM 
(ABS) OPERATION
The Bendix® TABS‑8™ Advanced Module uses Wheel 
Speed Sensors (WSS), a Modulator Relay Valve (MRV), 
and an Electronic Control Unit (ECU) to optimize the 
contact between the tires and the road surface during 
a braking event where excessive wheel slip – or wheel  
lock‑up – is detected.
When a situation is detected where the system needs to 
intervene, the ECU will activate the MRV to apply controlled 
brake pressure at the wheel ends.
The TABS‑8 Advanced Module ECU is able to modulate 
the brake pressure with greater speed and accuracy than 
a driver.
Normal Braking
During normal braking, the TABS‑8 Advanced Module 
functions as a standard relay valve. If the ECU does not 
detect excessive wheel slip, it will not activate the Antilock 
Braking System (ABS), and the vehicle will stop with normal 
braking.
Axle Control
Axle control uses the MRV to control the wheels at both 
ends of a given axle (or multiple axles in cases where the 
MRV is controlling several axles).
In the case of braking surfaces with poor overall traction 
(i.e. roads that are worn, slippery, or are made of loose 
gravel) – or braking surfaces with areas of poor traction 
(i.e. asphalt roads with patches of ice) – axle‑control ABS 
interventions will maintain the wheel that is not slipping at 
just under the speed that will lock the wheel. The system 
permits the other wheel (that is experiencing slippage) 
temporary periods of wheel‑lock during the intervention.
 
Axle control (select high) should not be used on fifth-
wheel dollies or steerable axles. In these cases, it 
could cause a yaw moment during braking that results 
in unwanted steering of the axle. Use a dolly control 
(select low) configuration.
When intervening on regular‑traction surfaces, a 
system configured for axle control performs similar to a  
side‑control, two‑modulator system.Steerable Axles
For applications that have both fixed and steerable axles, 
such as drawbar trailers (full‑pull trailers), a 4S/2M axle 
configuration should be used. These configurations have 
the ability to minimize yaw on steerable axles. 
ABS Fail‑Safe
The TABS‑8 Advanced Module is designed to react in a 
fail‑safe manner in the event of a system Diagnostic Trouble 
Code (DTC). For example, if the ECU detects that a sensor 
is not responding, an ABS system DTC will be set. The 
TABS‑8 Advanced Module will illuminate the trailer ABS 
indicator lamp and revert to a fail‑safe mode where some, or 
all, advanced ABS functions (including the Bendix® Trailer 
Roll Stability Program ‑ TRSP®) may not function. Even in 
cases where the ABS system is completely disabled, the 
standard pneumatic brake function of the vehicle will still 
be available, but without the benefits of ABS. The TRSP 
feature is also disabled with an active ABS system DTC. 
If the indicator lamp is illuminated, always have the ABS 
system serviced at the earliest opportunity. 
 
For all NPT fittings, use of a thread sealant is 
required. For NPTF fittings, the use of a thread 
sealant is recommended. This can be a pre‑applied 
or a hand‑applied sealant product (with PTFE). 
When using a hand‑applied sealant, use caution 
so as not to over‑apply. Always follow the fitting 
manufacturer’s pre‑applied or hand‑applied thread 
sealant recommendations. Use of PTFE tape is not 
approved and will void the Bendix ABS/TRSP valve 
warranty.  
54. BENDIX® TRAILER ROLL STABILITY 
PROGRAM (TRSP®) OPERATION
 
During a Bendix® Trailer Roll Stability Program 
(TRSP®) system intervention, the vehicle automatically 
decelerates. The Bendix® TABS‑8™ Advanced Module 
can slow the vehicle with or without the driver applying 
the brake pedal, and even when the driver applies the 
throttle. 
 IMPORTANT
If the TABS‑8 Advanced Module faults for any reason, 
the brakes will not be applied.
 
Even with TRSP system‑equipped vehicles, the driver 
remains responsible for ensuring vehicle stability 
during operation. The TRSP system only functions 
within the limits of physics. The system can help 
mitigate potential vehicle stability incidents, but 
cannot prevent them in all cases. Other factors – such 
as driving too fast for the road, traffic or weather 
conditions, over‑steering, an excessively high vehicle 
Center of Gravity (CG), poor road conditions, or 
insufficient vehicle maintenance – can cause vehicle 
instability that is beyond the capability of any stability 
system to mitigate.
 
The TRSP system should only be used on specific 
vehicle platforms that have been validated and 
approved by Bendix engineering.
 
The TRSP system is approved for use on A‑Double and 
B‑Train combinations. Use on A‑Triple combinations 
must be approved by engineering.The TRSP system reduces the risk of rollovers during 
driving by automatic application of the service brakes when 
the system detects potential rollover conditions. This is 
accomplished with monitoring sensors both at the trailer 
wheel ends and within the TABS‑8 Advanced Module. The 
TRSP system reacts by applying the trailer service brakes 
and slowing the vehicle combination.
The Bendix TRSP system uses the following sensors:
• Lateral Acceleration: A lateral accelerometer is 
located within the TABS‑8 Advanced Module. This 
sensor detects the lateral motion (or “roll”) of the 
vehicle as it moves. The TABS‑8 Advanced Module 
may be mounted either in line with – or at right angles 
to – the main trailer chassis to function correctly.   
NOTE:  Part numbers labeled R002  and forward can only 
be mounted in 0° and 180° from the vehicle driving direction 
to function correctly. Refer to  Table 7 and  Troubleshooting 
Section G for full details on acceptable installation 
locations.  NOTE : Do not attempt to change the location of 
the TABS‑8 Advanced Module without contacting Bendix 
for engineering approval.
 
It is the responsibility of the end‑user to ensure the 
TABS‑8 Advanced Module has been installed correctly 
and tested as per the Bendix recommended installation 
guidelines and system drawings. Incorrect installation 
of the TABS‑8 Advanced Module can result in impaired 
ABS and TRSP system functions, which could lead 
to loss‑of‑control of the vehicle, potential collisions, 
property damage, serious injuries, or death. 
• Vehicle Speed:  The TRSP system obtains 
information about the vehicle speed and rate of 
acceleration/deceleration from the Wheel Speed 
Sensors (WSS).
• Axle/Bogie Load: The trailer’s axle load information 
is obtained by the use of an integrated pressure 
sensor port (P42) of the TABS‑8 Advanced Module, 
where a direct reading of the suspension air spring 
pressure is taken. Trailer axle load information is 
configured during the installation test based off of 
information provided by the trailer/axle manufacturer.
TRSP Intervention with Driver Actions
It is possible the driver will also apply the brakes before 
or during a TRSP intervention by the TABS‑8 Advanced 
Module. In all cases, the Electronic Control Unit (ECU) 
monitors the driver’s brake application and compares that 
to the amount of braking the TRSP program has calculated 
needs to be applied. The pressure delivered to the brakes 
will always be the higher of the two (2) pressures.
6External Components:
• Wheel Speed Sensors (WSS):  See Figure 3 .  
Located at selected hubs, WSS detect the rotation 
of individual wheels and send an electrical signal to 
the ECU proportional to the rotational velocity. The 
primary WSS connectors, S‑C and S‑D, are used 
for detecting wheel speeds. The TABS‑8 Advanced 
Module has two (2) additional DIN connectors, S‑E 
and S‑F, which can be used as tri‑state auxiliary 
inputs. These sensors do not have wheel speed 
sensing capabilities.
 
Use of cable ties/tie wraps to attach Wheel Speed 
Sensor (WSS) leads to rubber hoses/jounce lines is not 
approved. The hose may expand during braking due to 
air pressure and the cable tie may not, so the conductor 
material/insulation of the speed sensor extensions 
may be damaged. Bendix instead recommends only 
open‑ended clips be used to hold sensor leads to 
jounce lines.

• Trailer Antilock Braking System (ABS) Indicator 
Lamp: See Figure 4 . Controlled by the Electronic 
Control Unit (ECU) to show the ABS status, the 
trailer ABS indicator lamp illuminates when a 
Diagnostic Trouble Code (DTC) is active. If there 
are no ABS DTCs present when ignition power is 
applied to the ECU, the lamp will illuminate as a 
bulb check lasting typically two (2) seconds and up 
to six (6) seconds at most.5. COMPONENTS
Installation of the Bendix® TABS‑8™ Advanced Module use 
the following components:
Internal Components:
• Electronic Control Unit (ECU): The ECU monitors 
the Wheel Speed Sensor (WSS) signals, lateral 
accelerometer sensor signal, and various pressure 
sensors (listed below) to determine when the 
Antilock Braking System (ABS) and/or the Bendix® 
Trailer Roll Stability Program (TRSP® ) intervention 
is required. When needed, the ECU actuates the 
internal pressure modulator valve to optimize the 
brake pressure. The ECU monitors the system to 
detect and warn the driver of any malfunctions. 
Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTCs) are stored in the 
ECU and can be reviewed to diagnose the TABS‑8 
Advanced Module system.
• Lateral Accelerometer Sensor: The lateral 
accelerometer sensor recognizes the lateral 
movement of the trailer and sends an electrical 
signal directly proportional to the trailer’s lateral 
acceleration to the ECU.
• Internal Load Sensor: For air suspension systems, 
the Load Sensor Port (P42) must be plumbed to a 
fixed-axle air ride bellows. NOTE : The sensor must 
not be plumbed to a lift axle bellows since they are 
not charged when the axle is not being used. The 
function of this sensor is to monitor the pressure 
and send an electrical signal directly proportional to 
the trailer’s axle load to the ECU.
• Brake Demand Pressure Sensor: This internal 
sensor (P4) monitors the trailer service brake 
pressure being applied by the driver and sends an 
electrical signal directly proportional to the driver’s 
brake demand to the ECU.
• Brake Delivery Pressure Sensor:  This internal 
sensor (P21) monitors the trailer service brake 
pressure that is being delivered to the wheel ends 
through, or by, the TABS‑8 Advanced Module 
system and sends an electrical signal directly 
proportional to the delivered trailer service brake 
pressure to the ECU.
• Modulator Relay Valve (MRV): An MRV is 
integrated into the TABS‑8 Advanced Module and 
is controlled electrically by the ECU to decrease, 
hold, or allow the fully applied brake pressure into 
the brake chamber to control the braking torque at 
the wheels.
• MRV Crack Pressure: The TABS‑8 ABS MRVs 
are supplied with a nominal crack pressure of  
4.5 ± 0.5 psi. 
7Figure 4 – Trailer ‑Mounted ABS Indicator Lamp
• 5‑pin Power Harness: See Figure 5. A power 
harness is required. Variations that include auxiliary 
sub‑harnesses are available as needed. 
• Lift‑Axle Sensing: If a trailer is equipped with a 
lift axle, then lift‑axle sensing must be used, unless 
configured for automatic lift-axle control (Refer to 
the Lift-Axle Control section below) . A pressure 
threshold switch must be installed in the lift bag for 
the lift axle and connected to the ECU. The ECU 
can then monitor the position of the lift axle and will 
compensate correctly for the load transfer to the 
other axle(s) when the lift axle is raised.
• Lift‑Axle Control: The Bendix® TABS‑8™ Advanced 
Module can be configured to automatically raise 
(and lower) lift axle(s) when a pre-configured load 
is sensed.
6. MOUNTING CONFIGURATIONS
• Tank (Nipple) Mount:  The TABS‑8 Advanced 
Module can be tank‑mounted using a schedule 
80 (heavy‑gauge steel) 3/4‑in. NPT nipple directly 
between the trailer supply tank and the module’s 
supply port. A tank with a reinforced port must be 
used.• Frame (Chassis) Mount: The TABS‑8 Advanced 
Module provides through‑holes for frame mounting 
directly to the trailer frame rail or cross‑member. It is 
recommended to use two (2) grade 53/8‑in. 16 bolts, 
typical length of 5 in., torqued to 180 ‑ 220 in‑lbs 
(20 ‑ 25 N•m). 
7. PIGTAIL WIRING HARNESSES
See Figure 5.  Pigtail wiring harnesses are available to 
connect the TABS‑8 Advanced Module with the ABS and 
other trailer system components. Pigtail harnesses are 
weather‑sealed at the connector interface and are clearly 
labeled for proper installation. Because of the over‑molded 
design of the TABS‑8 Advanced Module wiring harnesses, 
Bendix recommends the complete harness be replaced if 
damage or corrosion occurs.
See Figure 1. The TABS‑8 Advanced Module includes two 
(2) primary Wheel Speed Sensor (WSS) inputs and two (2) 
additional auxiliary inputs. The harnesses used for them 
are separate from the main pigtail harness.
ECU Connectors
See Figure 5. TABS‑8 Advanced Module ECU connectors 
use a 7‑pin TE Connectivity™ HDCS connector for brake 
light power, constant power, the trailer‑mounted ABS 
indicator lamp, ground, and – depending on the harness 
version – it may include the AUX 1 I/O. Note that some 
parts may be pre-configured with auxiliary features on the 
AUX 1 I/O and S‑E/S‑F inputs that may require additional 
harnessing as shown in Figure 5.

Correct WSS installation is necessary for optimal ABS 
operation.
Sensors should not be installed on a lift axle.
1. For increased corrosion protection, Bendix 
recommends that a high‑temperature‑rated silicone 
or lithium‑based grease be applied to the interior 
of the mounting block, the sensor, and to a new 
clamping sleeve.
2.  See Figure 3 . Install the new clamping sleeve fully into 
the block, with the retaining tabs toward the inside of 
the vehicle. Note that WS‑24 WSS must use the correct 
clamping sleeve to avoid problems associated with 
reduced retention force, such as sensor movement, 
and resulting ABS DTCs. 
3. Gently push (DO NOT STRIKE) the sensor into 
the mounting block hole until it bottoms out on the 
face of the tone ring. Secure the cable lead wire to 
the knuckle/axle housing 3‑6 in. (8‑15 cm) from the 
sensor.
4. Apply a small amount of dielectric non‑conductive 
grease to both the sensor and the harness 
connectors.
5. Engage the connectors and push them together until 
the lock tab snaps into place. It is permissible to use 
an extra wire retainer (Bendix Part Number 300122, 
or equivalent), if available, to hold the connectors 
together.
The friction fit allows the WSS to slide back and forth under 
force, but to retain its position when the force is removed. 
When the WSS is inserted all the way into the mounting 
block and the wheel is installed on the axle, the hub exciter 
contacts the sensor, which pushes the sensor back. Also, 
normal bearing play will “bump” the sensor away from 
the tone ring. The combination of these two actions will 
establish a running clearance, or air gap, between the 
sensor and the tone ring.
 
Wheel bearing maintenance is an important part of 
keeping the WSS in the correct position. Excessive 
wheel end play can result in DTCs in cases where the 
sensor is pushed too far away from the tone ring for a 
good signal to be produced. Maintain wheel bearings 
per the manufacturer’s recommendations.8. ANTILOCK BRAKING SYSTEM 
(ABS) INDICATOR LAMP
Trailer‑Mounted Lamp
The Bendix® TABS‑8™ Advanced Module controls an 
Antilock Braking System (ABS) indicator lamp to show 
the trailer ABS status. With power supplied by the towing 
vehicle – if there is an active Diagnostic Trouble Code 
(DTC), or during the bulb test at startup – the module 
illuminates the ABS indicator lamp by providing a 12.0 VDC 
signal. (The other side of the lamp is grounded.) The ABS 
indicator lamp output uses Pin 4 of the 7‑pin connector on 
the Module.
Dash‑Mounted Lamp (PLC Controlled)
TABS‑8 Advanced Modules use SAE J2497 standards 
to support PLC communication. The status of the 
trailer ABS is transmitted over the ignition power 
wire (the blue wire of the J560 connector) – Pin 2  
of the 7‑pin Module connector.
If there is an active DTC, during the bulb check at startup, 
the TABS‑8 Advanced Module will transmit a signal over 
the power line to the towing vehicle’s Electronic Control 
Unit (ECU), thus illuminating the trailer ABS indicator lamp 
mounted on the dash.
9. BENDIX® WS‑24™ WHEEL 
SPEED SENSOR (WSS)
See Figure 3. Wheel speed data is provided to the TABS‑8 
Advanced Module by the Bendix® WS‑24™ Wheel Speed 
Sensor (WSS). Typically, the WS‑24 WSS is installed in 
a mounting block that is welded to the axle housing. The 
WSS are protected by a stainless steel sheath. They are 
designed to be used with stainless steel clamping sleeves, 
sometimes referred to as a “retainer bushing,” “friction 
sleeve,” or “clip.” The clamping sleeve provides a friction 
fit between the mounting block bore and the WSS.
Vehicles have an exciter ring (often referred to as “tone 
ring”) as part of the wheel assembly. (From here on, this will 
be referred to as a “tone ring” throughout this document.)  
The default setting expects a 100‑tooth tone ring to be 
used. ( See Section 17  for more information.) As the wheel 
turns, the teeth of the tone ring pass the WSS, generating 
an Alternating Current (AC) signal which is delivered to the 
TABS‑8 Advanced Module ECU. The signal varies in voltage 
and frequency as the wheel speed changes.
See Figure 18 for an electrical system schematic showing 
the WSS connector pin locations.
10Antilock Braking System (ABS) Wiring on Towing 
Trailers
For use on towing trailers, to minimize voltage‑drop, the 
rear‑mounted SAE J560 connector MUST BE  connected 
directly to the front ‑mounted SAE J560 connector by a 
parallel wiring harness to the trailer wiring harness. 
Any auxiliary power circuit (non‑braking and running gear) 
shall be powered via the trailer Antilock Braking System 
(ABS). The trailer ABS shall provide power management 
to ensure the braking functions are given priority. If the 
power requirement for the auxiliary power circuit exceeds 
the maximum current allowed for an AUX I/O, an external 
relay or electronic relay, which is to be controlled by the 
trailer ABS, is acceptable for use. In this case, it is the 
trailer manufacturers’ responsibility to ensure this circuit 
is suitably designed and rated for the application and 
the switch-off time is fast enough to ensure the braking 
power supply is protected. This should be proven by 
practical tests ( Contact your local Bendix representative ). 
10. SAE J2497 POWER LINE CARRIER 
(PLC) DIAGNOSTIC LINK
See Figures 6 and 7. All newer towed vehicles transmit 
a signal over the power line to the towing vehicle ABS 
Electronic Control Unit (ECU). The signal, using a heavy 
vehicle industry standard known as Power Line Carrier 
(PLC/J2497), is broadcast by the trailer ABS ECU over the 
blue wire (ignition power line) of the SAE J560 connector 
and controls an in‑cab trailer ABS indicator lamp. The Bendix® TABS‑8™ Advanced Module provides a data 
link for PLC communication following the SAE J2497 
standard. Bendix® ACom® Diagnostic Software and the 
Bendix® Trailer Remote Diagnostic Unit (TRDU) both 
support PLC communication with the TABS‑8 Advanced 
Module. PLC communication is applicable for 12‑ volt 
vehicle applications only. The PLC communication is 
disabled for voltages greater than 18 volts.
Identifying and Measuring the PLC Signal
The TABS‑8 Advanced Module will continuously broadcast 
PLC messages that indicate trailer ABS status. At power‑
up, or during a trailer ABS DTC condition, the TABS‑8 
Advanced Module will signal the tractor ABS unit to 
illuminate the dash‑mounted trailer ABS indicator lamp.
Diagnostic tools are available that detect the presence 
of a PLC signal and perform further system diagnostics 
directly, using the power line. For more information on these 
diagnostic tools, contact your local Bendix representative or 
refer to your local authorized Bendix dealer or distributor. 
An oscilloscope can also be used to verify the presence 
and strength of a PLC signal on the power line. The PLC 
signal is an amplitude‑ and frequency‑modulated signal. 
Depending on the load on the power line, the amplitude 
of the PLC signal can range from 2.5 mV p‑p to 7.0 V p‑p.
Suggested oscilloscope settings are Alternating Current 
(AC) coupling, 1 volt/div, 100 µsec/div. The signal should 
be measured on Pin 7 of the J560 connector at the nose 
of the trailer.
11. SAE J1939 (CAN) DIAGNOSTIC LINK
The TABS‑8 Advanced Module provides a data link for 
transmitting CAN information following the SAE J1939 
standard. ACom Diagnostic Software and the Bendix® 
Trailer Information Module (TIM) both support CAN 
communication with the TABS‑8 Advanced Module. 
Ignition power must be provided to the TABS‑8 Advanced 
Module for the diagnostic link to be active. NOTE : Suitable 
harnessing will be required for this function.
Figure 6 – Power Line without PLC Signal
Figure 7 – Power Line with PLC Signal
1115. POWER ‑UP SEQUENCE
At power‑up, the TABS‑8 Advanced Module performs 
a series of self checks that can assist a technician in 
determining the ABS system status and configuration.
Trailer ABS Indicator Lamp
See Figure 8 . At power‑up, with no active Diagnostic 
Trouble Codes (DTC), the trailer ABS indicator lamp will 
illuminate for approximately two (2) to six (6) seconds as 
a bulb check and then turn off. If any active DTCS related 
to ABS or Bendix® Trailer Roll Stability Program (TRSP®) 
are present, the trailer ABS indicator lamp will remain 
illuminated. For non‑ABS or TRSP‑related DTCs at power‑
up, such as auxiliary functions, the trailer ABS indicator 
lamp will turn on for approximately six‑and‑a‑half (6.5) 
seconds as an extended bulb check and then turn off. If a 
PLC‑ready towing vehicle and trailer are powered at the 
same time, the TABS‑8 Advanced Module will also trigger a 
bulb check on the dash‑mounted trailer ABS indicator lamp.
Modulator Chuff Test at Power-Up
At power‑up, the TABS‑8 Advanced Module activates a 
modulator chuff test. This electrical and pneumatic ABS 
modulator test can help the technician identify problems 
with modulator installations and/or wiring.  With brake 
pressure applied, a properly installed modulator will cause 
two (2) rapid audible chuffs of air pressure. NOTE: The 
TABS‑8 Advanced Module will not perform a modulator 
chuff test with an active ABS DTC.
* Some vehicle manufacturers may illuminate the trailer ABS 
indicator lamp at power‑up regardless of whether a PLC 
signal is detected from the trailer or not. Consult the vehicle 
manufacturer’s documentation for more details.Power

13. BENDIX® ANTILOCK BRAKING 
SYSTEM (ABS) FLEX™ PROGRAM
The Bendix® Antilock Braking System (ABS) Flex™ program 
uses Auxiliary Design Language (ADL) to allow customized 
auxiliary functions to be carried out by the TABS‑8 
Advanced Module. Programs developed in the ABS Flex 
program may be downloaded at the production line or in 
the field to control non-braking functions of the trailer.
For example, the ABS Flex program can potentially 
communicate the status of tire inflation and/or temperature, 
reefer temperature, load presence, lift axle position, 
proximity/reverse alarm, and vehicle weight.
The ABS Flex program monitors the AUX I/Os and/or the 
SAE J1939 (CAN) and SAE J2497 Power Line Carrier 
(PLC) data links. Contact your local Bendix representative 
to discuss an ABS Flex program for your vehicle(s).
14. CUSTOMER SCRATCH PAD
The TABS‑8 Advanced Module has a customer scratch pad 
feature which allows the customer, or end‑user, to store up 
to 1,008 bytes of information. This information can then be 
read using the ACom Diagnostic Software.Table 3 – Auxiliary I/Os

1216. ODOMETER FUNCTION
Odometer
The Bendix® TABS‑8™ Advanced Module includes an 
odometer function to provide a means of storing the 
accumulated mileage of the vehicle. The mileage is 
computed by using information received from the vehicle 
Wheel Speed Sensors (WSS).
This feature is accurate to within 0.62 miles per power‑up 
and will typically store mileage up to 1,000,000 miles. The 
mileage can be displayed using PC diagnostics, a Bendix® 
Trailer Information Module (TIM), Bendix® Trailer Remote 
Diagnostic Unit (TRDU), or through blink codes.
Whenever the TABS‑8 Advanced Module is towed using 
a pre‑ 1997 tractor (with no constant power supplied to 
the trailer), no information about mileage will be stored 
during that time, and the mileage can be considered out 
of calibration.
Trip Counter
The TABS‑8 Advanced Module provides a counter to record 
the trip mileage. The feature can be accessed using PC 
diagnostics or the TIM.
Service Interval
The TABS‑8 Advanced Module provides a feature that can 
be used to indicate a service interval for the trailer. The 
service interval can be accessed using PC diagnostics or 
the TIM. If configured, the TABS-8 Advanced Module can 
flash the indicator lamp when the vehicle is at a standstill 
to indicate when the service interval has been exceeded.
17. NON ‑STANDARD TIRE SIZE
The TABS‑8 Advanced Module allows for tire rolling radius 
and tone ring tooth count parameters to be set for the 
axle being sensed using the Bendix® ACom® Diagnostic 
Software. These adjustments may be necessary for the 
module to accurately calculate the vehicle velocity and 
odometer mileage. Wheels of the same axle must have, 
and be set to the same, rolling radius and tone ring tooth 
count. Refer to the manufacturer’s tire specification for 
correct values.
The tone ring size is defaulted to 100 teeth, and the tire‑
rolling radius is defaulted to 511 revolutions per mile. Refer 
to Table 5  for parameter adjustments. Tone Ring 
SizeTire‑Rolling Radius 
– Allowable Range  
(in revolutions per mile)
60 teeth 712 to 1005
80 teeth 512 to 801
90 teeth 456 to 711
100 teeth 410 to 640
120 teeth 356 to 502
18. DIAGNOSTIC TROUBLE 
CODE (DTC) DETECTION
The TABS‑8 Advanced Module contains self‑testing 
diagnostic circuitry that monitors the Antilock Braking 
System (ABS) components and wiring. When the TABS‑8 
Advanced Module senses an erroneous system condition, 
it activates the external trailer‑mounted ABS indicator lamp, 
disables all or part of the affected ABS and/or Bendix® 
Trailer Roll Stability Program (TRSP® ) functions, and it 
stores the Diagnostic Trouble Code (DTC) in memory, so 
that the information is retained even when the power is 
removed. The TABS‑8 Advanced Module also uses Power 
Line Carrier (PLC) communications to send the system 
status to the towing vehicle.
For some DTCs, the TABS‑8 Advanced Module will 
automatically reset (“self‑heal”) the active DTC when the 
error is corrected. However, repeated occurrences of a 
given DTC can cause the code to “latch” – that is, be 
retained as active – even if the condition is only intermittent. 
Once the code is latched, a manual reset will be necessary. 
Technicians can use these latched codes to assist them 
in troubleshooting intermittent errors. After the problem is 
repaired, the DTC can be reset using blink code diagnostics 
or with a diagnostic tool.
19. PARTIAL ABS SHUTDOWN
Depending on the DTC detected, the ABS Electronic 
Control Unit (ECU) will partially or completely disable the 
ABS and/or TRSP functionality. In cases where the ABS is 
completely disabled, the vehicle reverts to normal braking 
(without ABS or TRSP interventions). Always repair ABS 
DTCs at the earliest opportunity.
ECU DTCs
All ABS functions are completely disabled. The system 
reverts to normal braking.Table 5 – Tone Ring Size to Tire ‑Rolling Radius
13Voltage DTCs
The operating voltage range is 8.0 to 32.0 VDC. If the 
voltage is detected as being out of range, the Antilock 
Braking System (ABS) and Bendix® Trailer Roll Stability 
Program (TRSP®) system braking features will be disabled, 
and the system will revert to normal braking. When the 
correct voltage level is restored, full ABS and TRSP is 
typically available again.
20. BLINK CODE DIAGNOSTICS
The Bendix® TABS‑8™ Advanced Module provides 
diagnostic functions through blink code diagnostics. This 
means that the technician – even without diagnostic tools – 
can read a series of ABS indicator lamp blinks to diagnose 
the DTCs being generated.
With no towing vehicle attached, the technician may enter 
the blink code diagnostics mode by providing constant 
power to the ignition circuit and then select the desired 
mode by toggling the brake light power input the specific 
number of times shown in Table 6.
With a parked towing vehicle attached, apply ignition power, 
and after the power‑up sequence is complete, enter the 
diagnostics mode by depressing and releasing the brake 
pedal the specific number of times shown in Table 6  for 
the desired mode.

Active DTC Retrieval 3
Inactive DTC Retrieval (DTC History) 4
Clear Active DTCs 5
Odometer Mileage Display 7
Depending on the blink code mode activated, the TABS‑8 
Advanced Module will blink the trailer‑mounted ABS 
indicator lamp to display active DTCs, inactive DTCs, and 
odometer mileage. Blink code diagnostics can also be used 
to clear active DTCs.
Wait until after the modulator chuff test before activating 
the brake light power. Alternatively, wait five (5) seconds.
NOTE: If certain DTCs are set, typically where modulator 
DTCs have occurred, the chuff test may not run.Following a single display of all available messages, the 
ABS indicator lamp will remain on for five (5) seconds 
and then return to normal operating mode. Blink code 
diagnostics can only be activated following a power‑up, 
where wheel speeds have not been detected. If the vehicle 
moves during the blink code diagnostics mode, the TABS‑8 
Advanced Module will cancel the blink code diagnostics 
and return to normal operating mode.
Blink code diagnostics must be activated within the first 15 
seconds of ignition power being applied.
If brake light power is continuously applied for more than 
five (5) seconds, blink code diagnostics will be disabled 
until the next time the ignition power is cycled.
Display Active DTCs
To display active DTCs, apply ignition power and depress 
and release the brake pedal three (3) times within 
15 seconds (allowing one [1] second between each 
application). Following this activation, there will be a five 
(5) second delay followed by a blink code display sequence 
of all active DTCs. 
Display Inactive DTCs
To display inactive DTCs – those that are not currently 
set, but have occurred and are stored in the Electronic 
Control Unit’s (ECU’s) memory – apply ignition power and 
depress and release the brake pedal four (4) times within 
15 seconds. Following this activation, there will be a five 
(5) second delay followed by a blink code display sequence 
of all inactive DTCs stored. 
Reset Active DTCs
To reset active DTCs, apply ignition power and depress and 
release the brake pedal five (5) times within 15 seconds. 
Following activation, there will be a five (5) second delay 
followed by:
a. If no DTCs remain, a blink code message of 1‑1, 
(System Fully Operational - No DTCs Detected ) and 
the ABS indicator lamp will cease to be illuminated; or
b. If there are remaining active DTCs, a sequence of 
blink codes will display all of the remaining active 
DTCs, and the ABS indicator lamp will stay on.
Resetting active DTCs with blink code diagnostics does 
not clear information from the DTC history. Both blink code 
diagnostics and diagnostic tools can retrieve inactive DTCs, 
but only diagnostic tools can clear this information.Table 6 – Blink Code Information
14Display Odometer Mileage
To display the trailer odometer mileage, apply ignition 
power and depress and release the brake pedal seven (7) 
times within 15 seconds. Following activation, there will be 
a five (5) second delay followed by a blink code display of 
the odometer information (x1000).
Example:  152,431 miles will be displayed as 152 (x1000) or 
one (1) blink (pause); five (5) blinks (pause); two (2) blinks.
Zeros (0s) will be displayed by the Antilock Braking System 
(ABS) indicator lamp strobing twice.
Odometer mileage cannot be altered with blink code 
diagnostics. Complete odometer information can be 
retrieved using a diagnostic tool.
21. AUXILIARY FEATURES
Rear Axle Suspension Dump
Some spread‑axle trailers are equipped with a rear‑axle 
suspension air bag dump feature to assist with cornering 
at low speeds. The Bendix® TABS‑8™ Advanced Module 
may be configured to use this feature. When this feature 
is used below a pre‑determined threshold vehicle speed, 
the Electronic Control Unit (ECU) will partially exhaust the 
rear-axle air suspension bags, and then reinflate them 
when the vehicle speed rises above the threshold. For 
more information about this feature, contact your local 
Bendix representative. 
Lift‑Axle Control (Automatic)
The TABS‑8 Advanced Module can be configured to 
automatically raise a lift axle when the load on the trailer 
drops below a configured level. Changes to the trailer to 
allow for this feature to include the use of the auxiliary 
outputs to operate a Lift Axle Control (LAC) valve. NOTE : 
Suitable harnessing will be required.
Low‑Pressure Warning Emergency (LPWE)
The TABS-8 Advanced Module can be configured for Low-
Pressure Warning Emergency (LPWE). By monitoring 
the status of an external pressure switch installed in the 
emergency line or delivery line of the spring brake valve, 
the TABS‑8 Advanced Module will alert the driver of a low‑
pressure condition by illuminating the trailer ABS warning 
lamp. When the vehicle is moving and the pressure in the 
emergency line is below approximately 65 psi, which is the 
minimum pressure to release the spring brakes, the ABS 
warning light will illuminate. The speed threshold at which 
the alert activates is configurable. The fault will clear once 
the pressure in the emergency line is above approximately 
65 psi. See Figures 18 and 22  for system schematics.NOTE:  Your trailer may be equipped with a Bendix Power 
Line Carrier (PLC) relay, which has the ability to indicate 
when there is a low‑pressure condition on the emergency 
line, using information received from the TABS‑8 Advanced 
Module.
Tire Inflation System (TIS) Sensing
The TABS‑8 Advanced Module is capable of monitoring 
the state of the Tire Inflation System (TIS) flow switch and 
it can be configured to automatically broadcast the status 
of this switch over the PLC. Additionally, it is possible to 
configure a TIS warning lamp that the ECU will control 
based on the state of the TIS. See Figures 18 and 22 for 
system schematics.
NOTE:  Your trailer may be equipped with a Bendix PLC 
relay, which has the ability to indicate when the TIS is active, 
using information received from the TABS‑8 Advanced. For 
TIS troubleshooting, refer to Section L. 
Pad Wear‑Sensing
The TABS‑8 Advanced Module is capable of monitoring the 
state of the Bendix disc brake pad wear sensors installed 
on the air disc brakes, and it will activate a Diagnostic 
Trouble Code (DTC) whenever it detects that at least one 
(1) of the pads has reached the wear limit. The TABS‑8 
Advanced Module can broadcast this DTC over the PLC. 
See Figures 18 and 22  for system schematics.
NOTE: Your trailer may be equipped with a Bendix PLC 
relay, which has the ability to indicate when the pad wear‑
sensing DTC is active,using information received from the 
TABS‑8 Advanced Module.

2023. TROUBLESHOOTING
Using Handheld or PC‑based Diagnostics
Troubleshooting and Diagnostic Trouble Code (DTC)
clearing, as well as beginning a reconfiguration, may also 
be carried out using handheld or PC‑based diagnostic 
tools such as the Bendix® Trailer Remote Diagnostic Unit 
(TRDU), Bendix® ACom® Diagnostic Software, or the 
Bendix® Trailer Information Module (TIM).
Bendix Antilock Braking System (ABS)  
Diagnostic Tools
ACom Diagnostic Software is an RP‑1210‑compliant 
PC‑based diagnostic software program that provides the 
highest level of diagnostic support for the Bendix® TABS‑8™ 
Advanced Module. With ACom Diagnostic Software, 
maintenance personnel can:
• Obtain DTC information (both active and inactive)
• Retrieve event history
• Clear inactive DTCs and event history
• Verify Electronic Control Unit (ECU) configuration
• Perform system and component tests
• Read/write customer information in the scratch pad
• Save and print information
• Receive troubleshooting assistance
When diagnosing the TABS‑8 Advanced Module using a 
PC and ACom Diagnostic Software, the computer’s USB 
port can be connected to the vehicle’s diagnostic connector 
through an RP‑1210‑compliant communication device.
For more information on the ACom Diagnostic Software 
or RP‑1210‑compliant tools, contact Bendix at 1 ‑800‑AIR‑
BRAKE (1‑800‑247‑2725) and follow the prompts for ACom 
technical support. TRDU Tool
See Figure 9. The TRDU tool (Bendix kit part number 
K101595) provides the technician with a visual indication 
of Antilock Braking System (ABS) component DTC 
information. The TRDU tool is specifically designed for use 
with Bendix® Trailer ABS.
 IMPORT ANT
Bendix makes no claims for its operation and/or 
usability with other brands of trailer ABS.

Figure 10 – TRDU Tool and Adapter  
The TRDU tool communicates across PLC and allows the 
technician to:
• Troubleshoot ABS system component problems 
using DTC reporting via LEDs.
• Reset DTCs on ABS ECUs by holding a magnet 
over the reset of the TRDU tool for less than six (6) 
seconds.
NOTE: The TRDU tool does not cover all possible 
DTCs. ACom Diagnostic Software should be used 
as the primary diagnostic tool. 
21How the Bendix® Trailer Remote Diagnostic Unit 
(TRDU) Tool Operates
When the Bendix® Trailer Remote Diagnostic Unit (TRDU) 
tool is plugged into the adapter – and the adapter/TRDU 
tool is installed between the trailer connector and the 
J560 connector of the towing vehicle that has the ignition 
on – all the LEDs will illuminate, and the green LED will 
flash four (4) times to indicate communications have been 
established.
If the Antilock Braking System (ABS) Electronic Control Unit 
(ECU) has no active Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTCs), 
only the green LED will remain illuminated.
NOTE: The TRDU tool does not cover all possible DTCs. 
Bendix® ACom® Diagnostic Software should be used as 
the primary diagnostic tool. 
If the ABS ECU has at least one (1) active DTC, the TRDU 
tool displays the first DTC by illuminating the red LEDs, 
indicating the malfunctioning ABS component and its 
location on the vehicle. See Figures 11 and 12.

If there are multiple DTCs on the ABS system, the TRDU 
tool will display one (1) DTC first, then once that DTC has 
been repaired and cleared, the next code will be displayed. 
The TRDU tool repeatedly blinks out the mileage stored 
once communications have been established. By counting 
the sequence of blinks and/or strobes on the blue LED, the 
odometer reading is given.
• VLT (Flashing indicates either an over‑ or under‑
voltage condition)To pinpoint the root cause and to ensure the system DTC is 
properly corrected the first time, additional troubleshooting 
may be necessary.
NOTE : When a TRDU tool is connected to a system with a 
Bendix® TABS‑8™ Advanced Module, and has established 
communications, the ECU will use the ABS indicator lamp 
to blink codes for all active DTCs.
TRDU Tool Reset Function
The magnetic reset switch is located by the letter "B" in the 
Bendix logo on the top of the TRDU tool. When a magnet 
(with minimum of 30 gauss) is held over the switch for less 
than six (6) seconds the "clear DTCs" command is sent. (If a 
magnet is not available, you may use a spare Wheel Speed 
Sensor [WSS], since its internal magnet will be sufficient.)
Additionally, it is recommended at the end of any inspection, 
the technician switches off and restores the power to the 
ABS ECU, then re‑checks the ABS indicator lamp and 
TRDU tool to see if they indicate any remaining DTCs.
Bendix® Trailer Information Module (TIM)
The TIM is a display device that combines the functionality 
of system diagnostics with the ability to display and store 
other trailer‑related information of value to an operator, 
driver, or workshop. Maximum benefit is obtained from the 
Module functionality when it is mounted on the trailer so it is 
able to record events that occur during driving. Alternatively, 
it may also be used as a workshop tool to access diagnostic 
information or to check the configuration, or to run an 
installation test. In both cases, the Module is connected to 
the J1939 5V TI (CAN) connection of the auxiliary connector 
which supplies the necessary information. Reference 
BW2867, Bendix® Trailer Information Module (TIM) G2 User 
Guide, on B2Bendix.com for more information. 
NOTE:  The TIM requires a harness with a 5V CAN.

SERVICING THE BENDIX® TABS‑8™ 
ADVANCED MODULE
 
Special considerations need to be taken to ensure the 
Bendix® TABS‑8™ Advanced Module has been properly 
installed on the trailer. These include:
• Location and orientation of the Module
• Correct plumbing of the Module
• Correct location of the Wheel Speed Sensors (WSS)
• Configuration of the Electronic Control Unit (ECU) for 
Antilock Braking System (ABS) and Bendix® Trailer 
Roll Stability Program (TRSP®) system parameters
• Installation test to verify proper installation of the 
ABS/TRSP system 
It is the responsibility of the end‑user to ensure the 
TABS‑8 Advanced Module has been installed correctly 
and tested as per the Bendix recommended installation 
guidelines and system drawings. Incorrect installation 
of the TABS‑8 Advanced Module can result in impaired 
ABS and TRSP system functions, which could lead 
to loss‑of‑control of the vehicle, potential collisions, 
property damage, serious injuries, or death. 
Prior to servicing the TABS‑8 Advanced Module, always 
perform the following steps:
1. Follow all industry safe maintenance practices 
including those within this document.
2. When possible, before removing the module, use the 
ACom Diagnostic Software to save the configuration 
to the desktop. After the TABS‑8 Advanced Module 
has been replaced, the technician can restore the 
previous configuration settings.
3. Turn the power off.
4. Drain the air pressure from all reservoirs.
5. Remove as much contamination as possible prior to 
disconnecting electrical connections and air hoses.
6. Note the TABS‑8 Advanced Module's mounting 
position on the vehicle.
REMOVING THE TABS‑8 ADVANCED 
MODULE
1. Open the end cover by sliding the locking tab to the 
left. If the module is to be reinstalled, retain the cover.
2. Disconnect the 7‑pin Electronic Control Unit (ECU) 
connector, any additional harnesses or shorting caps 
used on the auxiliary sensors, and the 2‑pin WSS 
connectors. Ensure the old connectors are marked 
appropriately for reinstallation.
3. Mark for reinstallation and then remove all air hoses 
connected to the TABS‑8 Advanced Module.
4. Remove the TABS‑8 Advanced Module from the 
vehicle by removing the mounting fasteners or by 
rotating the entire assembly counterclockwise from 
the tank mount.
23SERVICING THE CONTROL PORT FILTER
 
The Bendix® TABS‑8™ Advanced Module has an inline 
filter in the control port and the supply port ( See Figure 
2). These filters should be inspected and cleaned (if 
any contamination is found), every four (4) months, 
34,000 miles, or 1,200 operating hours. For severe 
applications, this inspection interval may be reduced. If 
the filter is found to be damaged, install a replacement. 
The filter should also be inspected as part of any 
troubleshooting where the service brakes are slow to 
apply and other possible causes have been ruled out.
INSTALLATION OF THE TABS‑8 
ADVANCED MODULE
 
All service replacement parts for the TABS‑8 Advanced 
Module are configured specifically by part number. 
As mentioned in the Servicing the Bendix TABS‑8 
Advanced Module section , ideally, before removing the 
module, use the Bendix® ACom® Diagnostic Software to 
save the configuration to the desktop. The technician 
can use the ACom Diagnostic Software to restore the 
previous configuration settings.
Always ensure the correct service replacement 
Electronic Control Unit (ECU) is being installed for 
the original TABS‑8 Advanced Module. To verify 
proper installation, perform the installation test using 
the ACom Diagnostic Software or the Bendix® Trailer 
Information Module (TIM).
Inspect the original mounting hardware. If replacement 
hardware is needed, use grade 53/8‑in. 18 bolts, nuts, and 
lock washers for the frame‑mount unit, or a schedule 80 
(heavy‑gauge steel) ¾‑in. nipple for the tank‑mount unit. 
Inspect the location selected for installation and clean as 
necessary.
NOTE: Inspect all components, including the replacement 
TABS‑8 Advanced Module, for any external damage, 
such as cracked valve ports, electronic housings, etc. 
Any components found to be damaged should not be 
installed on the vehicle and must be replaced.1. The TABS‑8 Advanced Module must be installed 
with the following considerations  (See Figures 14 
through 16):
• With the exhaust port facing downward and 
unobstructed with significant free space below  
(> 1 in. [2.5 cm])
• Within ± 100 in. (2.5 m) of the center of the axle(s) 
for proper balanced brake application
• Within ± 2 in. (5 cm) from the center line of the 
trailer (default) 
 NOTE : If the module needs to be mounted greater 
than the 2 in. (5 cm) from the centerline, the ECU 
will need to be configured for the module offset 
using ACom Diagnostic Software. Refer to Table 
7. The TABS‑8 Advanced Module is not available 
in 90° and 270°.

Table 7 – Module Offset Sign
• Yaw angle should be ± 10° as measured from the 
center line of the trailer
• Pitch angle should be ± 10° as measured from a 
flat horizontal plane
• Roll angle should be within ± five degrees (± 5°) 
as measured from a flat horizontal plane
• Tank‑mount Modules:  Install the nipple fitting into 
the modulator valve supply port. Rotate the entire 
assembly into the tank port until secure. Over‑
torquing of the tank nipple could cause damage 
to the valve body.
• Frame‑ mount Modules:  Torque the mounting nuts 
to 180‑220 in‑lbs.
2. Reconnect all air hoses and plugs to the Module. 
Depending on the installation, additional plugs may 
be necessary. Thread sealant products that contain 
Teflon may be used, however thread sealant tape 
is not recommended as there is a potential for tape 
material entering the valve and affecting the valve’s 
operation. Ensure no thread sealant enters the valve. 
All air hoses and fittings should be checked for leaks 
prior to returning the vehicle to service. Ensure the 
load sensor port P42 is connected to the suspension 
system at a location as far away from the height‑
control valve as possible, preferably directly to a 
fixed-axle air bag.
243. Reconnect the Electronic Control Unit (ECU) power, 
auxiliary (if present) and Wheel Speed Sensor (WSS) 
electrical connectors to the ECU. Apply a small 
amount of non‑conductive electrical grease to each 
connector pin before reconnecting.
  NOTE : The WSS must follow the orientation of the 
module as shown in Figure 17 for fixed-axle trailers.
•  It is necessary to fix the WSS to the orientation 
of the lateral acceleration sensor for plausibility 
checks between the sensors.
•  Care should be taken to ensure the WSS location 
matches the ECU orientation in Figure 17 . If this 
is not the case, a DTC will be generated and the 
Bendix ABS indicator lamp will be illuminated. 
•  Refer to the large label inside the connector cover 
for wheel speed designation, “S‑C” or “S‑D.” See 
Figure 1.
4. Leakage and operational tests must be performed 
before returning the vehicle to service.

LEAKAGE AND OPERATIONAL TESTS
 
For all NPT fittings, the use of a thread sealant is 
required. For NPTF fittings, the use of a thread 
sealant is recommended. This can be a pre‑applied 
or a hand‑applied sealant product (with PTFE). 
When using a hand‑applied sealant, use caution 
so as not to over apply. Always follow the fitting 
manufacturer’s pre‑applied or hand‑applied thread 
sealant recommendations. Use of PTFE tape is not 
approved and will void the ABS/ Bendix® Trailer Roll 
Stability Program (TRSP®) valve warranty.
1. Before performing the leakage tests, block the 
wheels.
2. Fully charge the air brake system and verify proper 
brake adjustment.
3. Make several trailer brake applications and check 
for prompt application and release at each wheel.
4. Perform the leak‑down test procedure: 
•  Set up the pressure circuits to apply emergency 
(red) line and service pressures with a regulator 
and a pressure gauge on each line. 
•  Apply 110 ‑ 120 psi to the trailer emergency (red) 
circuit to release the parking brake. 
• Apply the service brakes at 90 ‑ 95 psi. 
•  Identify and record the pressure from the gauge 
on the emergency (red) line and the service line.

•  Cut off the pressure to the emergency (red) 
line before the pressure gauge and monitor the 
pressure. If the pressure drops less than three 
(3) psi in one (1) minute, the emergency (red) line 
test passes. If the pressure drops more  than three 
(3) psi in one (1) minute, identify and correct the 
source of the leak on the emergency (red) line. 
• If the emergency (red) line test passes, repeat the 
test for the service line. If the pressure drops less 
than two (2) psi in one (1) minute, the test passes. 
If the pressure drops more  than two (2) psi in one 
(1) minute, identify and correct the source of the 
leak on the service line. 
• A soap and water solution can be used to identify 
sources of leaks on the fittings and valves. 
• If available, a Lite‑Check® machine can be used 
to perform the leak‑down test.
5. Apply power and monitor the power‑up sequence 
to verify proper system operation. See Section 15.6. Calibrate and set the odometer parameters, if 
necessary, using a diagnostic tool. See Section 16.
7. Perform an installation test using a diagnostic tool. 
Minimum tests that are required to verify the proper 
installation of the Bendix® Antilock Braking System 
(ABS)/Bendix® Trailer Roll Stability Program (TRSP®) 
system are:
•   Electronic Control Unit (ECU) Information: 
This test provides the user with specific ECU 
information. It is required that no Diagnostic Trouble 
Codes (DTCs) (other than “installation test not 
completed”) are present and that the ECU has 
been configured.
•   Wheel End Sequence Test:  During this test, 
checks are carried out that verify the correlation 
of the wheel installed with a Wheel Speed Sensor 
(WSS) and the pressure modulator that controls 
the pressure to the associated brake.
•   Lateral Acceleration Test:  The installation angle 
information is retrieved from the ECU and compared 
to the predefined limits (± 5°). This test verifies the 
unit is installed as close to horizontal as possible.

•   Axle Load Sensing Test (Air Ride): The test 
has the user verify the expected measurement 
of the load pressure sensor, Port 42, for air ride 
suspensions. The program provides the reading 
of the sensor.
•   Customer Scratch Pad: The tester is requested to 
input data into the fields displayed on the screen. 
This data will be stored in the Electronic Control 
Unit (ECU) and also can be stored to a file on the 
computer or printed out for reference.
8. Where a safe location (i.e. restricted access area or 
test track) is available, it is possible to road test the 
Bendix® Antilock Braking System (ABS) function by 
making an abrupt stop from a vehicle speed of about 
20 mph (32 kph) to check for proper function. The 
wheels should not enter a prolonged lock condition 
and the ABS function should be audible. It is the 
responsibility of the technician to perform this test 
in a safe location.
ABS WIRING
 
Disconnect the electrical connectors from the ABS/
Bendix® Trailer Roll Stability Program (TRSP®) 
controller before welding on the trailer.
 
Dielectric grease should be applied to electrical 
connectors to help protect against moisture intrusion.
All connector leads of the Bendix® TABS‑8™ Advanced 
Module pigtail harness are weather‑sealed at the connector 
interface and are clearly labeled for proper installation.
Bendix provides over‑molded versions of the TABS‑8 
Advanced Module wiring harness and Bendix recommends 
the complete harness be replaced if corrosion or damage 
occurs.When troubleshooting ABS wiring, some general rules 
should be followed where applicable.
1. Check all wiring and connectors to ensure they 
are secure and free from visible damage (i.e. cuts, 
abrasions, etc.).
2. Check for evidence of wire chafing due to poor 
routing or poor securing of wires.
3. Check connectors for proper insertion and locking.
4. Verify the connector pins are properly greased with 
a non‑conductive electrical grease compound.
5. Connector terminals must not show signs of 
corrosion or exposure to the environment.
6. Never pierce wire insulation when checking for 
continuity.
7. Do not deform individual pins or sockets during 
probing with a volt/ohm meter.
8. It is strongly recommended that all wiring harnesses 
and sensor leads are properly secured at least every 
18 in. (46 cm).
9. Apply a moderate amount of non‑conductive 
electrical grease to each connector pin before 
reconnecting.
27MISCELLANEOUS MAINTENANCE 
 
GLAD HAND MAINTENANCE
• NEVER POUR ANY LIQUIDS (alcohol, 
anti‑freeze, additives, etc.) into the 
glad hands. Liquids may cause the 
o‑rings and seals to swell, which may 
result in lubrication loss and leave 
harmful residues.
• Prevent nesting insects and contaminants from 
entering and blocking the air hoses. Check that 
screens are present and clean.
• Drain the trailer air tanks a minimum of every six 
(6) months.
• Liquids/contaminants can cause TRAILER AIR 
BRAKE FAILURE  and/or the INABILITY TO 
RELEASE  the trailer parking brakes.
  
BENDIX® ANTILOCK BRAKING SYSTEM (ABS) 
SYSTEM POWER ‑UP CHECK 
At power‑up the trailer ABS indicator lamp should 
briefly illuminate “ON” as a bulb check.
If the indicator lamp does not illuminate at power‑up, 
the ABS system may not be powered, or the bulb may 
need to be replaced. Service the trailer ABS system.
• If the lamp remains “ON” after power-up there 
may be active Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTC). 
Service the trailer ABS system. (To ensure full 
ABS/Bendix® Trailer Roll Stability Program 
(TRSP®) functionality, service as soon as 
possible.)
• Other Important Practices:
• Follow all standard industry safety practices.
• Sealant for ABS fittings: Use pre‑ or hand‑
applied; Never PTFE tape (voids Bendix ABS 
warranty).
• Use open‑ended clips (never cable ties) to hold 
sensor leads to jounce lines.
• Drain the trailer air tanks a minimum of every 
six (6) months. 
• Disconnect the electrical connectors from the 
ABS controller when welding on the trailer.

retrieved from the Bendix® TABS‑8™ Advanced Module 
by using blink code diagnostics or a diagnostic tool. The 
following troubleshooting flowcharts will help the technician 
isolate the cause and confirm whether the problem resides 
in the component, wiring, or connectors.
Troubleshooting should always begin by observing the 
dash‑ or trailer‑mounted Bendix® Antilock Braking System 
(ABS) indicator lamp during the TABS‑8 Advanced 
Module's power‑up sequence. If it is necessary to take electrical measurements, always begin by taking voltage 
and resistance measurements at the 7‑pin Electronic 
Control Unit (ECU) pigtail harness connector.
Once the source of the problem is found, isolate the area 
needing repair by repeating the measurements at all 
connections in the affected circuit towards the modulator, 
Wheel Speed Sensor (WSS), etc.
No voltage or resistance measurements are to be made on 
the ECU electrical header connector pins of the Module.

Apply the service brakes. Repeat 
the voltage measurement with 
brake lamp power to the trailer, 
between the brake lamp power 
(pin 1) and the Ground (pin 3) of the 
ECU connector.
Verify the voltage drop 
measurements are no less than 1.0 
VDC from the vehicle voltage at 
both the ignition and brake power 
inputs.
With a volt/ohm meter, check 
the power and ground wiring. Look 
for corroded or damaged wires or 
connectors.
If repairs are made, rerun the 
power‑up sequence. Go to 
Section  A.
If proper loaded and unloaded 
voltage is measured at the ECU 
connector, and no corrosion or 
damage is found on the wiring,

36SECTION F: TROUBLESHOOTING THE
LOAD SENSOR (OUT ‑OF‑RANGE CONDITION)
NOTE : The indicator lamp for this condition is illuminated only after the vehicle moves.
Turn off the power to the module.
 
For air suspension system trailers:
Verify/inspect the following:
1. Check that the reservoir(s) in the system has air pressure.
2. Tee an air gauge into port P42 and physically check that there is air pressure at the port.
3.  Check that the load port P42 is connected to the primary suspension air bags at a location  as far from the 
height control valve as possible . Verify that the air hose is not kinked.
4.  Switch the power to the module on. Using the Bendix® ACom® Diagnostic Software, open the PRESSURE 
screen and select START. Read the pressure shown for the load port (P42). If the pressure value is not as 
expected, close the PRESSURE window and open the CONTROLLER CONFIGURATION window. Then, 
select the  LOAD AND SENSOR CONFIGURATION  tab and view the  LOAD SENSING  panel. Verify that the 
current SENSING TYPE  is shown as INTERNAL . If not, change the selection to INTERNAL . 
5.  Check that the suspension height control valve is functioning correctly.
6.  Check for air leakage in the suspension system.
•  Using the ACom Diagnostic Software, open the BENDIX® TRAILER ROLL STABILITY PROGRAM 
(TRSP® ) SENSOR screen and select START . Find the load (in‑lbs) that the sensor is registering, and 
verify that the actual trailer load is consistent with the value found.
•  Note the values shown on the screen for the current load and pressure. Verify that the values shown on the 
screen for the empty and laden weight and pressures are correct. See the NOTE  below.
•  Using the ACom Diagnostic Software, where the value does not appear to be correct, select MODIFY , and 
enter the correct value(s) on the configuration screen. 
NOTE : Use a scale to obtain the actual empty trailer weight and use a pressure gauge to obtain actual empty 
trailer suspension air bag pressure. Where possible, obtain the load/pressure curve from the suspension 
manufacturer for the specific suspension/air bag combination to find the expected values for this vehicle. Then, 
rerun the power‑up sequence. Go to Section A.
371. Check that the Electronic Control Unit (ECU) is installed correctly (expected orientation to vehicle).
Each Bendix® TABS‑8™ Advanced ECU comes preconfigured for a certain orientation (0/90/180/270 degrees from 
the vehicle driving direction). NOTE:  Part numbers labeled R002  and forward can only be mounted in 0° and 180° 
from the vehicle driving direction; use the Figure below  to verify the correct WSS installation for said orientations. Use 
Bendix® ACom® Diagnostic Software to view the current configured orientation of the TABS-8 Advanced ECU on the 
controller configuration screen. Then use the Figure below to verify the TABS‑8 Advanced ECU is installed per the 
configured orientation. If it is determined that the ECU is not installed per the configured orientation, verify that the 
configured orientation is correct for the part number of the ECU. This will require contacting a Bendix representative 
at 1-800-AIR-BRAKE (1-800-247-2725). If the configured orientation matches the orientation for the specific ECU part 
number, reinstall the ECU to match the configured orientation. After reinstalling the ECU for the correct orientation, 
perform an installation test using ACom Diagnostic Software or a Bendix® Trailer Information Module (TIM).
If the configured orientation of the ECU does not match the orientation for the specific part number, it is possible 
that the configured orientation was manually configured using ACom Diagnostic Software at a previous date. If 
possible, change the configured orientation back to the correct orientation for the given part number. This may require 
assistance from a Bendix representative at 1-800-AIR-BRAKE (1-800-247-2725). After reconfiguring the orientation 
of the ECU, reinstall per the new orientation if required. Perform an installation test. 
2. Check if the WSS S‑C input and S‑D input are swapped.
Since this Diagnostic Trouble Code (DTC) is caused by the ECU comparing the difference in wheel speed readings 
between left and right WSS to cross‑check with the on‑board lateral accelerometer’s data, if the sensors are reversed, 
a DTC can be triggered. The correct installation location of WSS S-C input and S-D input are specific to the ECU’s 
orientation. Each TABS-8 Advanced ECU comes preconfigured for a certain orientation. Use ACom Diagnostic 
Software to view the orientation on the controller configuration screen. Then use the Figure below  to verify the correct 
installation of WSS for this orientation. Use ACom Diagnostic Software to run the TABS‑8 Advanced installation test 
to verify if the installation of Wheel Speed Sensors (WSS) S‑C input and S‑D input is correct.SECTION G: TROUBLESHOOTING THE ELECTRONIC CONTROL
