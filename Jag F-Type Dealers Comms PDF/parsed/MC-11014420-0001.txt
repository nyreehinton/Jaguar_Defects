The timing chain must be pretensioned using special tool 2 455 654 to ensure the timing chain is installed
correctly . Refer to Repair Instruction 1 1 31 005 “Adjusting the timing of the camshafts”, see step 8. This center
button the special tool will identify if the chain is correctly tensioned, over- slackened or over-tensioned.

A16.
 
If the cylinder head cover gasket is not damaged, it can be reused .

Repair and Tool Hints:
 
 Cylinder 6 intermediate lever may interfere
when trying to install the intake camshaft timing
tools.
 
Place the variable valve timing (VVT) motor in
minimum lift before installing the camshaft
timing tools. 
 
Use a 4 mm Allen socket (1) and a ratchet (2)
to turn the VVT  motor counter clockwise until it
stops at the minimum lift end stop.
 
  
Tool 83 30 5 A53 587 may bind when removing
it from both of the V ANOS adjusters, the plastic
washer (1) may be binding the tool and will not
allow it to collapse when the screw is
loosened. 
 
Using a fine metal file, reduce the outside
diameter of the plastic washer by approximately
1 mm to avoid this interference.
 
Removing the washer entirely could result in
the screw and wedge falling into the engine, the
washer avoids loosening the screw too much.
