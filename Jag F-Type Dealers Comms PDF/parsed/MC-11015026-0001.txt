BRAKE LAMP SWITCH  
REMOVAL  
CAUTION:  Never remove or install the brake lamp switch while the brake pedal arm is disassembled from the 
brake booster push rod.  
CAUTION:  Do not depress, lift or move the brake pedal during brake lamp switch removal to avoid switch 
damage. Do not depress, lift  or move the brake pedal during brake lamp switch installation to avoid 
improper switch adjustment.  
1. Remove the steering column opening cover  (Refer to 23 - Body/Instrument Panel/COVER, Steering Column 
Opening/Removal and Installation)  . 
 
2. Disconnect the brake lamp switch wire harness 
connector.  
3. Press the brake lamp switch against the bracket while 
rotating the switch housing clockwise 45° to align the 
tabs to the keyed hole in the brake pedal support 
bracket.  
4. Pull the brake lamp switch straight out of the keyed hole 
and remove it from the vehicle.  
 
 
NOTE:  If damage to the switch is present for any 
reason, the switch is to be replaced. If a 
switch is removed and the plunger length 
differs from a new switch, the switch should 
always be replaced and not reinstalled. The 
nominal height for a new switch (tip of the 
plunger to the body of the switch) is 16.9 mm 
(0.67 inch).

Brake pedal switch plunger verification:  
 
<<<NOTE >>> If a switch  is suspected as f aulty, follow the plunger verification below.  
 
1. Measure the exposed plunger initial position length (16.90mm should be the 
initial measurement).  
 
2. Manually, press down, the switch plunger and then release it.  
 
- If plunger has a range of motion when pressed and released, measure again the 
plunger length after releasing it and compare it with the initial position length.  
 
- If plunger fails to emerge the plunger is damaged  and will require replacement of the 
brake switch.
