Root Cause:
Low batter y voltage
ECM calibr ation tuning
Verification
Verify F ault Code 1966 is not activ e.
Verify no driv ability issues wer e detected.
Check if any of the sympt om fault codes ar e activ e.
Resolution
If Fault Code 1966 is activ e, follow published Troubleshooting Tree.
Fault codes occurr ences ar e pending an ECM calibr ation code r elease and tuning adjustment.
Continue t o monit or for futur e ECM calibr ation code r elease. Tempor ary solutions for when fault
codes log during the following situations:
Start-up
If engine speed is below  800 rpms, manually r aise t o appr oximately 800 rpm b y tapping
the acceler ator pedal position during warm-up
OR
Adjust par ameter “Low Idle Speed” t o 800 rpm in the r ecommended Cummins®
electr onic ser vice t ool or equiv alent
Idle Low Load
If engine speed is below  800 rpm during idling, tempor arily incr ease the engine rpm t o
appr oximately 800 rpm b y tapping the acceler ator pedal position
OR
Enable the par ameter “ Adjustable Low Idle Speed” in the r ecommended Cummins®
electr onic ser vice t ool or equiv alent
Adjust par ameter Low Idle Speed Additional Settings > Step Siz e to 50 rpm
Cruise Contr ol
For vehicles running on adaptiv e cruise contr ol, change in the r ecommended Cummins®
electr onic ser vice t ool or equiv alent the par ameter “Load Based Torque Contr ol” >
Torque Contr ol > Smar t Torque 2 > F uel E conomy Adjustment F actor one le vel closer t o
max fuel economy (see Table 1).
For vehicles with standar d cruise contr ol, manually incr ease r oad speed prior t o hill
climbs.

Notes:
If regularly hauling mor e than 30,000 k g [~66,000 lbs] and existing adaptiv e cruise contr ol
setting is Base, Max per formance, or P erformance, mo ve to Economy
The lower on the char t (closer t o economy), the gr eater the r eduction in fault code
occurr ences per r ating type.
