SERVICE:
Do not replace any parts.
This symptom can occur if the driver changes the position of the gear shifter from P to D or R very 
quickly after starting the engine and the starting process is not completed.  Inform the driver to 
pause briefly after starting the vehicle before shifting into D or R.
If the issue occurs, turn the ignition off and wait 10 seconds before restarting the car.
* New ECM software to prevent this symptom is expected to be released during Q2 2025. This TJ 
will be updated when new information is available.
ECM = Engine Control Module
