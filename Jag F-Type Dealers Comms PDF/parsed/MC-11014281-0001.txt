Description : To support the launch of Campaign 776, d ealers received Glyptal 1201 Red 
Enamel from an alternative supplier, however, this is not the preferred product 
recommended by Thermo King E ngineering due to its lower viscosity . Glyptal 
1201 can still be used by applying two coats . Allow 15 minutes of cure time 
between coats if using Glyptal 1201.  
Dealers should have now received a second shipment of the correct Glyptal 
1201B  Red Enamel , which  is approved by Thermo King E ngineering.  Thermo 
King recommends verifying  Glyptal 1201B is purchased to support Campaign 
776, and for future service needs when maintaining equipment. Glyptal 1201B 
can be purchased from our third- party supplier, Vallen.  
Service Procedure for Units Already Completed in Field Using Glyptal 1201:  
1. Technicians/Customer should inspect the amount of Glyptal 1201 coating during the next 
preventive maintenance service.  
2. If Glyptal 1201 coating is lacking, remove any corrosion present or replace parts and apply new coating of Glyptal 1201B.
