Correction:  
1. Are BCM & BECM updates available?
   - Yes: Update software to the latest version. Then do EVAC & Fill. Measure the recovered refrigerant volume (Fill
Tolerance is+/-30g). Proceed to step 2.
   - No: Do EVAC & Fill. Measure the recovered refrigerant volume (Fill Tolerance is+/-30g). Proceed to step 2.
2. Did you recover full charge?
   - Yes: Proceed to step 3.
   - No: Do a visual inspection of the AC Hardware and ﬁnd the source of the leak. Replace the leaking part then reﬁll
system,then go to step three 
3.  Perform Air Conditioning (A/C) System Performance T est in Service information.  If problem persists follow
SI procedures 
 
Additional notes:
For AC Hardware visual inspections, use a black light to detect refrigerant leaks. Ignore dye traces around the ﬁll valve
area and clean them with Fluorescent Dye Cleaner when ﬁrst found & monitor the area for bubbling or new dye formed
after running the system..
When doing evacuation and recharge, use a clean oil catch bottle in the AC machine to look for any debris in the
system.
