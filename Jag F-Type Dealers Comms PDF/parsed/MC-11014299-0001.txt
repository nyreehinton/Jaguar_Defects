Correction:
If you experience one of the conditions above, please check the following as this ma y be
causing your concern:   
Inspect the air suspension compressor air inlet hose for being pinched or twisted and
preventing air from entering the air suspension compressor . The air inlet hose assembly is
shown as #17 below . If you ﬁnd the air inlet hose pinched or twisted, repair as needed.
 
Example of twisted hoses on the 2024 Hummer EV SUV
 
Example of a pinched hose on a 2023 Cadillac Escalade below:
 
 
 
The 2024 Hummer EV Pickup ma y have a kink ed hose due to an air inlet hose
fastener that is located in an incorrect mounting hole that restricts the air inlet
hose. See Below:
Locate the air suspension line assembly brack et in the right rear of the vehicle and mak e
sure the air inlet line retainer is attached to the brack et as shown above in the locator hole
mark ed by # 2.   
If the hose retainer is in location #1, it will restrict the air inlet hose and you will need to
remove the retainer clip and install it in location #2.  
 
Note: Engineering is reviewing the diagnostic for C1197 SYM 92 in SI which instructs
technicians to replace the Air Suspension Control Module Manifold or the Automatic Level
Control Module. Unless there is visual evidence that there is an issue with either of these
components, do not replace them until the suspension air compressor is replaced and the
vehicle is re-evaluated for the C1197 SYM 92 DTC.
