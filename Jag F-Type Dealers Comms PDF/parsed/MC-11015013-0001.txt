Warranty  Extension:  2016 -20 HR-V CVT Premature  Belt Deterioration  
Supersedes  21-047, Dated  April 29 , 2023, to revise  the information  highlighted  in yellow.  
 
APPLIES TO  
 
Year  Model  Trim  VIN Range  
2016 –20 HR-V 2WD  & AWD  (CVT  models 
only)  ALL Check  the iN VIN status  for eligibility.  
 
REVISION  SUMMARY  
Under  INSPECTION PROCEDURE AND CONFIRMATION OF FAILED CVT , information was changed . 
 
BACKGROUND  
Due to the possibility  of early  deterioration  of the Continuous  Variable  Transmission  (CVT)  drive  belt, American  Honda  is 
extending the warranty coverage on these CVT models to 7 years from the original date of purchase or 150,000 miles, 
whichever comes first. If the PCM software was previously updated in service bulletin 21 -046, Product Update: 2016 -20 
HR-V Software Update and CVT Inspection , the warranty extension applies, since the CVT primary drive belt is now a 
OBD -monitored part due to the addition of DTC P271E.  
 
CUSTOMER  NOTIFICATION  
Owners of affected vehicles will be sent a notification of this campaign. 
Do an iN VIN status  inquiry  to make  sure the vehicle  is shown  as eligible.  
Some  vehicles  affected  by this campaign  may be in your new or used  vehicle  inventory.  Repair  these  vehicles  before  they 
are sold.  
 
CORRECTIVE  ACTION  
Replace  the Continuously  Variable  Transmission  (CVT).  
NOTE:  Update  the Continuously  Variable  Transmission  (CVT)  PCM  software,  and do the CVT inspection  before  doing  this 
repair. Refer to service bulletin 21 -046, Product Update: 2016 -20 HR -V Software Update and CVT Inspection.

CUSTOMER INFORMATION: The information in this bulletin is intended for use only by skilled technicians who have the proper tools, equipment, 
and training to correctly and safely maintain your vehicle. These procedures should not be attempted by “do -it-yourselfers,” and you should not 
assume  this bulletin  applies  to your vehicle, or  that your vehicle  has the condition  described.  To determine  whether  this information  applies,  contact 
an authorized Honda automobile dealer.  
Page  2 of 23  NOTE: After the vehicle was updated and if the CVT failed the magnet inspection in service bulletin 21 -046, Product 
Update:  2016 -20 HR-V Software  Update  and CVT Inspection , to order  a replacement  transmission  fill out AT/CVT  Order 
form under Reman Parts/Special Orders section on iN. You will need to have the following information:  
• Provide  a clear  picture  of the magnet  sticking  on the CVT oil pan at the inspection  area (this picture  should  have  been 
taken  during  the CVT magnet  inspection).  Also,  write  the last seven  characters  of the VIN on the transmission  oil pan. 
 
• Drain  the CVT fluid through  a paint  strainer  as shown  below.  Provide  a clear  picture  of the inside  of the strainer 
showing any contamination.  
 
• Provide  a clear  picture  of any contaminants  on the end of the oil pan drain  plug.  
 

Page  3 of 23  • Upload  the three  images  to the Tech  Line Image  Upload  page  before  submitting  the CVT order  form on iN. If you have 
not contacted Tech Line then use the last 7 digits of the VIN for the Tech Line Reference No.  
• If the 11th character  of the VIN has a letter  instead  of a number,  replace  it with a zero.  
• Select  Tech  Line Agent  Name  –Tech_Line  . 
 
• Fill out the AT/CVT Order  form under  Reman  Parts/Special  Orders  section  on iN. If the vehicle  is beyond  the 5 year / 
60,000 mile warranty term use 21047 as the Goodwill VSC Authorization. This will allow the order to be processed 
under the Extended warranty coverage, then continue filling out the remaining required information on the form.  
 
• Once  the CVT order  & three  images  have  been  received,  your order  will be reviewed  by Remanufactured Parts 
Operations  (RPO ). Additional  requests  and images may be required by RPO before release of the CVT.

Page  6 of 23  INSPECTION  PROCEDURE  AND  CONFIRMATION  OF FAILED  CVT 
The transmission  inspection  utilizes  a special  magnet  to detect  any metal  fragments  that may have  been  shed  from the 
CVT belt. These  fragments  will collect  in the oil pan. The inspection  is done  by placing  a clear  template  on the CVT oil 
pan. Refer to service bulletin 21 -046, Product Update: 2016 -20 HR -V Software Update and CVT Inspection . 
If the PCM was updated and the CVT failed the magnet inspection on service bulletin 21 -046, Product Update: 2016 -20 
HR-V Software  Update  and CVT Inspection , place an RPO order on SIS for  a replacement  transmission.  You will need  to 
have the following information:  
• Provide  a clear  picture  of the magnet  sticking  on the CVT oil pan at the inspection  area (this picture  should  have  been 
taken during the CVT magnet inspection).  
• Drain  the CVT fluid through  a paint  strainer  as shown  below.  Provide  a clear  picture  of the inside  of the strainer 
showing any contamination.  
• Provide  a clear  picture  of the magnet  on the end of the oil pan drain  plug.  
• If you encounter  a situation  where  the magnet  sticks  but you do not find any metal  on the drain  plug or inside  the 
strainer, you may be instructed to perform additional confirmation steps by RPO.
