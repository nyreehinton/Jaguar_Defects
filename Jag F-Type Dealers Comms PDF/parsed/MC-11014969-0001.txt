Subject:BMW Service Action - Tailgate Lock B51 04 25
Vehicles affected by the Tailgate Lock Service Action (B51 04 25) may be delivered with verbal
communication to the customer about this campaign prior to delivery. 
Inform the customer that the issue is NOT safety-related, but that it is possible the trunk/hatch may
not completely latch immediately upon closing.  If this occurs, the trunk or hatch will noticeably re-
open while the vehicle is stationary.  Parts will be available soon, and this will be remedied at a
future workshop visit.
As the Service Action is loaded throughout our systems, you may see the vehicles turn Green within
the ROSS Tools.  However, this is only temporary and will turn Red the next day.  Once parts
become available, we will turn vehicles Green. 
 
If vehicles have any other open Campaigns, they must be completed prior to delivery to the
customer.
 
Sincerely,
Technical Service
