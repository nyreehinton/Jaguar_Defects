CAUSE

Replacement of driver or passenger front doors on vehicles up to 7/201 1 requires use of original air bag
sensor with the new design door . If the new style from 7/201 1 sensor is used it will set an air bag fault for
open circuit since it is pinned dif ferently in the electrical connector . 
 
The only door design available from parts is designed for vehicles produced from 7/201 1 but fits the earlier
vehicles.
 
CORRECTION
Install correct door pressure sensor for vehicles produced up to July 201 1.
 
If a new design door is used with the original sensor seal the gap between round sensor and square hole in
door.
