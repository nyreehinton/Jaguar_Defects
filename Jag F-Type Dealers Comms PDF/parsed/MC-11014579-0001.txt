ConditionSome customers may comment on unwanted/false park assist alerts suggesting there is
an object in front and/or behind the vehicle when there is nothing there. This condition
can lead to the system Condition disabling itself and a "Park Assist Off" message will be
displayed in the DIC. Also, the LED in the park assist switch will be disabled.Subject:
Page 2 February, 2025 Bulletin No.: 22-NA-068
CauseThe causes of the condition may be burrs at sensor openings in the bumper or incorrectly
installed isolator rings on sensors.
If an issue exists with the way the park assist sensor and/or bezel is mounted or painted,
the sensor can ground out or get squeezed and pick up normal vehicle vibrations. These
normal vehicle vibrations would not ordinarily be picked up by the sensor when properly
mounted and isolated from the vehicle. These vibrations can be interpreted by the park
assist sensor as an object, when in fact there is no object present. Because the sensor is
working normally, there will be no DTC's set
Correction Review bumper condition and correct burrs and installation issues.
Service Procedure
• Using GDS2, go into Module Diagnostic/Park Assist Module/Data Display/Parking Assist Disable History 1-4
and 5-7 Data and view the disable history.  If the disable history shows "Trailer or Other Object Attached" this is
a good indication there could be an issue with a park assist sensor(s) grounding out or getting squeezed.  Don't
overlook the obvious things such as a trailer hitch installed or anything else attached to the vehicle.
Note: Be careful if the disable history shows "Manual Disable" along with "Trailer or Other Object Attached". Many
times, in an effort to make the Park Assist system operational, a customer will try cycling the park assist manual
disable switch. This can cause "Manual Disable" to be displayed in the disable history and may mislead your
diagnostics.
• Question the driver to see if they have received any unwanted/false park assist alerts. If so, the Parking Assist
Display, located in the DIC, will indicate where the false alert is being displayed/detected. Use this information to
help narrow down which sensor(s) should be inspected. Example: the Parking Assist Display is falsely
indicating an object at the left front of the vehicle.  With this information the left front park assist sensors/bezels
should be inspected more closely.
• If there are no unwanted/false parking assist alerts and they only have an issue with the Park Assist Off
message, then on trucks with front and rear parking assist, try the following to help determine if the issue is with
the front or rear sensor(s)/bezel(s).  Connect GDS2 and go into Module Diagnostic/Park Assist Module/Data
Display/Parking Assist System Data and monitor the following two parameters: "Attached Object Detected
Front" and "Attached Object Detected Rear".  See which parameter goes "active" when the Park Assist Off
message is displayed and use this to determine if the issue is with the front or rear sensor(s)/bezel(s).  This step
can be omitted on vehicles with only rear park assist, as it would be only the rear sensor(s)/bezel(s) to inspect. 
Note: On vehicles with both front and rear parking assist systems, it cannot be determined if there is an issue with
either the front or rear parking assist sensor(s) or bezel(s) by the transmission position (Drive or Reverse) alone.
 Example: When the vehicle is shifted into reverse, both the front and rear parking assist sensors are active.  Also,
while driving forward the system determines if anything is attached to either the front or rear of the vehicle.  
Once you have determined which sensor(s) to inspect, look for the following issues:
1. Perform a visual inspection of the park assist sensor(s) and bezel(s). Look for any stone chips/dents, paint
chips, damage, etc., as well as any issues with the silicone ring.  See example (1) below of a silicone ring which
is not properly installed. If any issues are found, then repair as necessary.

Note: In most cases, these next inspections will require the bumper to be removed.
2. Inspect the park assist sensor bezel(s) for not being properly mounted in the bumper hole.  If the bezel in not
properly mounted into the bumper hole it can lead to a sensor grounding out or the sensor getting
squeezed. The bezel has four locking tabs that secure the bezel to the bumper. Make sure all four mounting
tabs are fully engaged. See example (2) for a mounting tab that is not fully engaged (view from the back side of
the bumper/bezel). If any tab is not fully engaged, it can protrude into the opening where the park assist sensor
mounts and cause it to ground out or get squeezed. See example (3) for a tab not fully engaged and protruding
into the opening for the sensor. If any of the bezel mounting tabs are not fully engaging, inspect the following:
− Burrs on the back side of the bumper hole, see example 5 and 6
− Excessive paint/clear coat on the bumper around the mounting hole, see example 7. 
− Plastic flashing on the park assist sensor bezel itself, see examples 8 and 9.
− Inspect the bumper hole for being slightly too small. The bezel should easily slide into the bumper hole
without force.
If any of these concerns exist, then use a file or grinding wheel to remove any burrs or flashing. If needed,
enlarge the bumper hole opening.  On any exposed/bare metal apply an Anti-Corrosion Treatment, see
Document ID: 2096919. After repairing any bumper hole or bezel issues then reinstall the bezel and make
sure the four mounting tabs are fully engaged and then reinstall the park assist sensor. There is no need to
replace the bezel or sensor unless they are damaged.

3. If the park assist sensors have been painted, it is important that only the tip of the sensor is painted and clear
coated.  The tip of the park assist sensor is isolated from the rest of the sensor body by an internal decoupling
ring.  If paint or clear coat is allowed to run or drip down the sides of the sensor's tip and/or into the gap
between the body and sensor tip, as shown below, this can cause the sensor to ground out.

GM bulletins are intended for use by professional technicians, NOT a "do-it-yourselfer" . They are written to inform these
technicians of conditions that may occur on some vehicles, or to provide information that could assist in the proper
service of a vehicle. Properly trained technicians have the equipment, tools, safety instructions, and know-how to do a job
properly and safely. If a condition is described, DO NOT assume that the bulletin applies to your vehicle, or that your
vehicle will have that condition. See your GM dealer for information on whether your vehicle may beneﬁt from the
information.
