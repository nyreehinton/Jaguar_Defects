RECALL: THIS MODIFICATION HAS TOP PRIORITY AND MUST BE    
PERFORMED IMMEDIATELY TO ENSURE CUSTOMER SAFETY  
 
FRONT BRAKE CALIPER CHECK AND REPLACEMENT IF NECESSARY 
 
FEBRUARY 11, 2025 
 
AFFECTED MODELS: 
2024 ES 350, ES 500 
2025 ES 350, ES 500 
 
RESTRICTIONS: AFFECTED MODELS ARE LINKED BY VIN IN DEALER.NET 
 
 
BASIC INFORMATION:  
GASGAS North America has determined that a defect which relates to motor vehicle safety exists with 
certain 2024 and 2025 GASGAS motorcycles equipped with BRAKTEC front brake calipers. 
 
Irregularities were found in the casting structure of one of our brake supplier's subcontractors. In the worst 
case, this can lead to the front brake caliper cracking in the area around the upper guide pin.  See Figures 
1 and 2. 
                                   
                           Figure 1:                                                Figure 2:                                                                          
 
If the front brake caliper cracks at the upper guide pin it may reduce the braking systems effectiveness.  
For this reason, the manufacturer of the brake caliper casting must be checked on affected vehicles and 
replaced if necessary.

The differentiation between the suppliers of the cast raw parts of affected vehicles can be seen directly on 
the brake caliper, see Figures 3 and 4.  
 
PROCEDURE FOR REPAIR: 
 
Check and replace front brake caliper if necessary: 
 
1. On affected vehicles, check which cast raw part manufacturer the brake caliper installed on the 
vehicle is from and therefore whether it is affected by the replacement (see Figures 3 and 4). 
- If the brake caliper is not affected by the replacement (Fig. 3 / supplier 1), continue with point 9. 
 Use campaign code 00 when creating the warranty claim. 
- If the brake caliper needs to be replaced (Fig. 4 / supplier 2), continue with point 2.  
 Use campaign code 01 when creating the warranty claim. 
 
Important note:  
This distinction only applies to vehicles linked to the recall!  
Vehicles produced later may also have these "centering holes” that are circled below in red but are 
not affected by the recall or replacement! You must check the VIN in the Dealer.net vehicle history 
first to determine if the vehicle is linked to this TI bulletin. 
 
                 
        Figure 3:                                                                       Figure 4:  
        Front Brake caliper from OK sub-supplier 1             Front Brake caliper from non-OK sub-supplier 2 
        Calipers that look like this do not need replaced.    If the caliper looks like this and is also linked by 
                                                                                               VIN in Dealer.net it must be replaced.

2. Remove the front brake caliper from the vehicle and disconnect the brake line. 
3. Remove the brake pads, brake caliper bracket, bolts and split pins from the "old" brake caliper and     
install them in the "new" brake caliper. 
4. Refit the brake hose to the brake caliper, see table 1 for torque. 
5. Refit the brake caliper to the vehicle, see table 1 for torque. 
6. Bleed the brake system. 
7. Carry out a short test drive to ensure that the brake system is functioning properly. 
8. Make the old part unusable (e.g., sawing in) and document it accordingly in the warranty claim with 
a photo and keep it in accordance with the retention period. 
9. Create a warranty claim with photo documentation of the "old" brake caliper in GasGas Dealer.net. 
 
 Avoid contact between brake fluid and painted parts. Brake fluid attacks paint!   
 Small amounts of brake fluid may leak out, therefore protect surrounding surfaces with proper 
protective covering to prevent damage. 
 Immediately wash off brake fluid residues or stains with water. 
 
We shall not provide a description of general workshop methods. Likewise, safety rules that apply in a

have been inspected and repaired during this campaign. Be sure to submit your warranty request for 
reimbursement on every unit repaired to ensure accurate compliance numbers.

RE: Affected models:  
2024 ES 350, ES 500 
2025 ES 350, ES 500  
 
Dear GASGAS customer,  
 
This notice is sent to you in accordance with the requirements of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act.  
GASGAS North America has determined that a defect which relates to motor vehicle safety exists with certain 2024 and 
2025 GASGAS motorcycles equipped with BRAKTEC front brake calipers. 
 
Irregularities were found in the casting structure of one of our brake supplier's subcontractors. In the worst case, this can 
lead to the front brake caliper cracking in the area around the upper guide pin on affected front brake calipers. 
 
If the front brake caliper cracks at the upper guide pin it may reduce the braking systems effectiveness. For this reason, 
the supplier of the brake caliper casting must be checked on affected vehicles and replaced if necessary. 
 
To remedy this defect, it is necessary to have the front brake caliper inspected by an authorized GASGAS motorcycles 
dealer to verify which supplier produced the front brake caliper that is mounted on your motorcycle to determine if it is 
defective or not defective.   
 
 If during the inspection your front brake caliper is determined to not be defective then the front brake caliper does 
not need to be replaced. 
 
 If during the inspection your front brake caliper is determined to be defective then the front brake caliper needs 
to be replaced.   
 
Please contact your authorized GASGAS motorcycles dealer (log onto www.gasgas.com  for a complete dealer listing) as 
soon as possible to arrange having the front brake caliper inspected and replaced if necessary.  It is suggested that you 
call your local authorized GASGAS motorcycles dealer to make an appointment to have the recall repair performed. The 
procedure will take approximately 30 minutes.  However, it may be necessary to leave your motorcycle with the dealer for 
a longer period of time depending on their work schedule and if they need to order replacement parts. Please present a 
copy of this letter along with your motorcycle to your local authorized GASGAS motorcycles dealer. There will be no charge 
for this service.
