Fitting 
To ensure the radiator is fitted correctly in the frame; rubbers are supplied with each unit, which must be located in the correct positions around the frame. When re-fitting the cassette radiator 
you must ensure that all the rubbers are put back in the correct position to avoid any vibration/rubbing issues. 
 
Note: 
Due to manufacturing tolerances each radiat or can have slightly different dimensions. 
 
Please make sure that the radiator is securely mounted into the frame so all rubbers supplied are holding the radiator firmly in place.  If the radiator is loose; spacer washers need to be fitted under the AV mounts. This will allow the 
top rubbers to be in contact with the radiator when the bottom tray is in position. 
 If all rubbers are not in contact with the radiator, the radiator will become loose in the frame and allow too much movement in all directions. This will result in rubbing on the side of the radiator tanks. 
 
Should any movement be observed the following action will need to be carried out: 
Spacer washers are to be positioned underneath the radiator AV mounts as required, they will 
locate the radiator into the top rubbers. On t he EPA07 cooling pack the bottom tray is assembly 
into fixed holes. (See example drawing.) The expec tation is no more than 3 spacer washers will 
be required per side (6 in total).
