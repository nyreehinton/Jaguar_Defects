Only properly trained personnel, who passed all applicable HV T echnical T raining Courses, should
perform repairs which require disconnecting, or removal of High V oltage battery components on any
Hybrid or Electric V ehicle. W ork performed on High V oltage systems by unqualified persons may
result in severe injury or damage to the vehicle. Additional safety information is found in Repair

Prior to disconnecting, or the removal of any HV component, the HV system needs to be disabled
and secured (by means of the HV Disconnect Switch) by a properly trained technician, who has a
minimum HV Qualification level after completing the T echnical T raining Course ST1824 (Alternative
Drive Part 1). Once the vehicle’ s HV system is disabled (the “Blitz” - lightning bolt icon displayed in
instrument cluster , see below), a technician without HV Certification may remove a HV component
(e.g., EH Heater , EKK Compressor , EME Control Unit, et.), except for the High V oltage Battery .
 
 
 
High V oltage Battery removal and rework can be performed ONLY by a HV Specialist T echnician
(certified by the T echnical T raining Course ST1825 – Alternative Drive Part 2), AND with a HV Battery
Certification level corresponding to a specific Electric or Hybrid vehicle (e.g., to repair GEN4 battery
of G05 PHEV , certification from T echnical T raining Course “ST2006 – SP44 HV Battery” is required).
 
Therefore, to perform this  SIB 61 16 22  a GEN5 battery Certification is required from T echnical
Training Course “ST2205 Generation 5 High-voltage” class).
