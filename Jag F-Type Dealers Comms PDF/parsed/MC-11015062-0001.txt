Title: Vehicle Programming Information Associated With 2-Box Engines (2002-2006 i6, v6, & v8)
Applies To: 2-Box Engines (2002-2006 i6, v6, & v8)
 
CHANGE LOG  
Please refer to the change log text box below for recent changes to this article:
 
02/05/2025 - Initial Article Release
 
 
DESCRIPTION
 
This document aims to enable technicians to:
1. Proficiently identify 2-box engine control systems.
2. Comprehend the programming intricacies related to such systems.
3. Autonomously execute programming tasks without necessitating interaction with technical.
 
Timeline:
 Software/Hardware Integrations:
 
ServiceMaxx 1708:  Supported. Used for diagnostics & parameter changes.
DLC Fleet Tool: IK2600074  For changing Idle Shutdown Timer time & mode, service interval, and engine warning
protection system. This only works with legacy communication cables.
NavKal:  Supported.
HeRo:  Supported.
DLB:  Supported.
360 W rite Up:  Supported.
The programming station  works with this engine type.
Naming Convention:
 
“Diamond Logic Controller” (DLC) is a term used to describe International’ s brand-new (as of 1994) electronic engine
control system. This third version of International’ s electronic engine controls was referred to as DLC 2 or DLC II. The “2”
stands for “2-Box” – indicating that this version of the engine electronic control system has 2 modules.
The previous two engine electronic control systems International produced were referred to as DLC 3 and DLC 1 – both
indicating the number of modules used to control the engine at that time. Each of these first three generations of electronic
engines had its own diagnostic software package: DLC 3, DLC 1, and DLC 2. These were also referred to as Master
Diagnostics 3, Master Diagnostics 1, and Master Diagnostics 2 (MD3, MD1, MD2).
How 2 Box Modules W ork:
 
ECM:  Engine Control Module. The ECM holds both the calibration and the parameters. 2-Box ECM’ s are dealer
programmable. Both the calibration and parameters can be changed/programmed.
IDM:  Injector Driver Module. The IDM only holds a calibration. There are no programmable parameters in the IDM. The
IDM can be programmed through NavKal. The ECM must be present on the data link in order to program the IDM.
Functional info:  This engine type only uses both an ECM and an IDM that both connect to the public 1708 data link. Both
modules need to be present on the same data link (either vehicle or programming station) in order to program either
module.
 
Connecting T o A 2 Box Engine:
  
When ServiceMaxx 1708 connects to a 2-box engine, you should see data similar to the screenshot above.
 
Engine Type: DLCII I6 (2004-2006), DLCII V6 (2005-2006), DLCII V8 (2002-2006)
 Reference Number: Will show 16 digits (1st 8 digits are ECM cal / 2nd 8 digits are IDM cal)
Engine Family Rating Code: (EFRC) should show a 4 digit number
Vehicle Identification Number: Will show the full 17 digit VIN
Engine Serial Number: Will shows the full 14 digit ESN
 Transmission TypeShould correctly reflect the installed transmission (unless the vehicle has
an Eaton automated manual transmission – then it is normal for
ServiceMaxx 1708 to show an Allison transmission)
Rated Horsepower Should correctly show the rated horsepower
Total Miles Should show correct total vehicle distance
 Total Fuel Used Should show correct total fuel used
Total Engine Hours Should show correct total engine hours
 
When connecting with ServiceMaxx 1708 or NavKal, if you have to manually select the engine type,
you will select one of the options from the screenshot below .
 
  Source Addresses:
Even though this engine has 2 modules, it only broadcasts a single source address of 128.
The ECM broadcasts the source address. The IDM does not broadcast a source address.
The source address is broadcast on the 1708 data link.
This source address can be seen in the snif fer in either ServiceMaxx 1708 or NavKal.
If you are using a Nexiq Communication cable, you can check in the Nexiq Device Tester to see source address 128
shows up.
 2 Box Module Parts Information:
 
DLC2 I6:  Look up ECM/IDM part numbers by VIN.
DLC2 V6 (VT275):  Look up ECM/IDM part numbers by VIN.
DLC2 V8 (VT365):  Look up ECM/IDM part numbers by VIN. This engine type had two dif ferent generations of ECM.
These ECMs are physically dif ferent and are not interchangeable (you can physically install the wrong ECM, but it will not
be programmable) .
1.1 ECMs (used from 2002-2003) are connected to the IDM with tubular aluminum spacers between the ECM and
IDM. 1.1 ECMs were only used on vt365.
2.2 ECMs (used from 2003-on) had cast aluminum wings molded into the body of the ECM. 2.2 ECM’ s bolt directly
to the IDM without the need for a tubular spacer . See the picture below for the visual dif ferences between 1.1 vs. 2.2
ECMs.  
 
If you need engine identification information, please see IK2600242 .
2 Box Horsepower Quotes:
 
Horsepower increases are supported for this engine type. Follow the process outlined in IK2600069  to submit a case file
for a horsepower quote. If the engine you’re considering is already rated at the highest possible rating, then no increases
are available. There are 4 dif ferent ratings that are highest in their class. See the chart below for those highest ratings.
There is no need to submit a case requesting a horsepower increase for an engine that is already at one of these ratings –
as there are no increases available.
 
Interantional does not support changes from standard torque ratings to high torque ratings (and vice versa). So, if you
have a DT466 with 12NPR (standard), it is not possible to increase to a higher rating. If you submit a case file with this
type of request, it will receive the response that there are no increases available.
 
We have had reports of a discrepancy between the dealer-facing 2-box horsepower ratings data that is available in the
CT400 (sales data book) vs. the data that International uses to evaluate horsepower quotes – specifically that some
horsepower ratings in the CT400 show a dif ferent torque range (standard torque vs. high torque) than what we provide in
a case file horsepower quote. Below is the full list of 2-box i6 ratings, their HP/TQ ratings, and their torque ranges
(standard vs. high torque). International will use the information below when developing the horsepower quote.
 
2 Box Engine Swaps:
 
See IK2600047  for information about engine swaps. Programming changes may be needed in order to accommodate an
engine swap. There are some instances where International CANNOT  support and engine swap. If you have any doubts
about whether your engine swap will be supported by International, please start a case file with the V ehicle Programming
group and we will let you know if International will support the swap. It is advisable to do this BEFORE swapping the
engine.
Common Programming Issues W ith 2 Box Systems:
 
1. ECM Loses Parameters:
      a. Symptoms:
            i. 141, 142, & 621 faults
            ii. Miles/Hours/Fuel default to “0”
            iii. VIN/ESN are lost
            iv . EFRC is lost (defaults to “FFFF”)
            v . Transmission type defaults to “Manual”
            vi. Engine power decreases
                       vii. Screenshot below
                           
  
      b. Possible Cause – Battery disconnect
            i. Fix – Program as a blank module with NavKal. To prevent lost parameters due to a battery disconnect, wait at

      c. Possible Cause – Bad ECM
            i. Fix – program as a blank module with NavKal. If the ECM loses its parameters again, replace the ECM. See
IK2600185  for more details.
2. NavKal Error 1 17 Module Type:… 623…:
 
      a. This error can be caused by communication from other modules interfering with NavKal’ s communication on the
data link.
            i. Fix – either pull transmission/ABS fuses, or use programming station. See TL2900048  for info about the
programming station.
3. NavKal Error 8:  indicates NavKal expected to see a module on the data link, but couldn’t detect it.
