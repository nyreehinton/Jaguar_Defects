ConditionGM recovers a small number of electric vehicle battery packs from customer-owned
vehicles in the field each year for further engineering study and analysis. This program
helps GM improve future EV products, analyze the performance of the battery packs in
customer driven EVs, and proactively identify and correct potential issues before they can
impact battery or vehicle performance. GM selects batteries for participation in this
program based on various engineering criteria, including manufacturing data, vehicle
location, vehicle mileage, and battery charging behavior. The customers involved will be
contacted proactively by GM to visit a GM EV certified dealer for a battery pack
replacement under warranty.Subject:
