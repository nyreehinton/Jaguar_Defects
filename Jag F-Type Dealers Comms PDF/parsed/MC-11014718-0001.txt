4 Check whether thread of respective
weld nut (5) and scr
ew (4) on rear
retaining bracket (2) and front retaining
bracket (3) is damaged.p
When checking the r
espective weld nut
(5), it must not be possible to unscrew
the screws (4) sluggishly and there must
not be any visible damage to the thread.
If one of the screws (4) unscrews
sluggishly or if there is visible damage to
the thread, replace respective weld nut
(5) and screw (4).
Otherwise, the correct torque of the
respective screws (4) cannot be
guaranteed.
p
At least one of the four follo
wing weld
nuts (5) is damaged and must be
replaced.
Otherwise, correct mounting of the rear
retaining bracket (2) or front retaining
bracket (3) cannot be guaranteed.
i To do so, unscrew screws (4) from
rear retaining bracket (2) and front
retaining bracket (3).
If the screw (4) can be unscrewed
sluggishly or if ther
e is visible damage
to the thread,
↓
replace respective damaged weld nut (5)
with corr
esponding screw (4); to do so,
continue with operation step 5.
If it is not possible to determine
whether the scr
ew (4) can be unscrewed
sluggishly or if there is any damage to
