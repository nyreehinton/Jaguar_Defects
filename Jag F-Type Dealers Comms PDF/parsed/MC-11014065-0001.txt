Attention:  For EV Involved Vehicles: The repairs outlined in this bulletin must only be completed at an authorized 
EV dealer and repairs must be performed by a technician who has successfully completed the 
applicable  technical training required to perform this repair.   
Involved vehicles will be r epaired either through dealer repairs as described in this bulletin or through 
over the air (OTA) programming.  Dealers can and should perform the procedure in this bulletin on any 
vehicle with an “open” status on the Investigate Vehicle History (IVH) scre en in GM Global Warranty 
Management system.  Due to the fact that vehicles will be closed in IVH through successful OTA 
programming, dealers should always check the status in IVH before performing any vehicle repairs .  
Refer to Technical Service Bulletin 2 1-NA-043 for properly maintaining vehicles in dealer inventory.

Warranty Claim Code Information Retrieval  
6125774  
If the Warranty Claim Code was not recorded on the Job Card, the code can be  retrieved in the SPS 2 system as 
follows:  
1. Open TLC on the computer used to program the vehicle.  
2. Select and start SPS2.  
3. Select Settings  (1). 
4. Select the Warranty Claim Code tab  (2). 
The VIN, Warranty Claim Code and Date/Time will be listed on a roster of recent programming events.   If the code is 
retrievable, dealers should resubmit the transaction making sure to include the code in the SPS Warranty Claim Code 
field.  
Service Procedure  
Note:  Carefully read and follow the instructions below.  
• Ensure the programming tool is equipped with the latest software and is securely connected to the data link connector. 
If there is an interruption during programming, programming failure or control module damage may occur.  
• Stable battery voltage is critical during programming. Any fluctuation, spiking, over voltage or loss of voltage will 
interrupt programming. Install a GM Authorized Programming Support Tool to maintain system voltage.   Refer to 
www.gmdesolutions.com  for further information.    If not available, connect a fully charged 12 V jumper or booster 
pack disconnected from the AC voltage supply. DO NOT connect a battery charger.  
• Follow the on -screen prompts regarding ignition power mode, but ensure that anything that drains excessive power 
(exterior lights, HVAC blower motor, etc) is off.  
• Clear DTCs after programming is complete. Clearing powertrain DTCs will set the Inspection/Mai ntenance (I/M) 
system status indicators to NO.  
Important:  The service technician always needs to verify that the VIN displayed in the TLC left side drop down menu and 
the top center window match the VIN plate of the vehicle to be programmed prior to using Service Programming System 
2 (SPS2) for programming or re programming a module.  
• For the TLC application, service technicians need to always ensure that the power mode (ignition) is “ON” before 
reading the VIN from the vehicle’s VIN master module and that they do not select a VIN that is already in the TLC 
applica tion memory from a previous vehicle.  
• If the VIN that shows up in the TLC top center window after correctly reading the VIN from the vehicle does not match 
the VIN plate of the vehicle, manually type in the VIN characters from the vehicle VIN plate into the  TLC top center 
window and use these for programming or reprogramming the subject module with the correct vehicle VIN and 
software and/or calibrations.

• The Body  Control Module ( BCM) is the  primary  module (for VIP EV vehicles) that TLC reads to determine th e VIN of 
the vehicle.  If the VIN read from the vehicle by TLC does not match the VIN plate of the vehicle, the BCM  also needs 
to be reprogrammed with the correct VIN, software and calibrations that match the vehicle’s VIN plate.   
Caution:   Be sure the VIN selected in the drop down menu (1) is the same as the vehicle connected (2) before beginning 
programming.

screen instructions. After a successful programming event, the WCC is located in the Service Programming System 
dialogue box of the SPS Summary screen. No fu rther action is required. Refer to the Warranty section of the bulletin.  
1. Reprogram the Body  Control Module. Refer to K9 Body Control Module: Programming and Setup  in SI.
