Bulletins are intended for use by qualified technicians,  not 'do-it-yourselfers'.  Qualified technicians are 
properly trained individuals who have the equipment, tools, safety instruction, and know-how to do a job 
properly and safely. NOTE:  If you believe that a described condition may apply to a particular vehicle, DO 
NOT assume that it does.  See your Nissan dealer to determine if this applies to your vehicle.

VOLUNTARY EMISSIONS RECALL CAMPAIGN  
2016-2017 TITAN XD DIESEL; PM SENSOR 
 
CAMPAIGN ID #: PD128  
APPLIED VEHICLES: 2016-2017 Titan XD (A61) 
APPLIED ENGINES: Cummins 5.0L Diesel 
 
Check Service COMM or Dealer  Business Systems (DBS)  
National Service History to confirm campaign eligibility . 
 
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
Nissan is conducting this voluntar
y emission s recall campaign on certain specific model 
year 2016-2017 Titan XD vehicles equipped with a diesel engine, to install a Particulate 
Matter (PM) Sensor and reprogram the Engine C ontrol Module (ECM). This service will be 
performed at no charge to the cu stomer for parts or labor. 
  
IDENTIFICATION NUMBER 
 
Nissan has assigned identificat ion number PD128 to this ca mpaign. This number must 
appear on all communication and documentation of any nature dealing with this campaign
. 
  
DEALER RESPONSIBILITY 
 
It is the dealer’s responsib
ility to check Serv ice COMM or Dealer Business Systems (DBS) 
National Service History for the campaign status  on each vehicle falling within the range of 
this voluntary emissions recall which for any reason enters the service department. This 
includes vehicles purchased from private parti es or presented by transient (tourist) owners 
and vehicles in a dealer’s inventory.  Federal law requires that new vehicles in dealer 
inventory which are the subject of a safety recall must be corrected prior to sale.  
Failure to do so can result in civil penalties by the Na tional Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration .  While federal law applies only to new vehicles, Nissan strongly 
encourages dealers to correct any used vehicles in  their inventory before they are retailed.

Attention California Dealers 
 
 
An Emission Recall Campaign Completion (ERCC) label must be filled ou t by the technician 
performing the repair, and then attached to the underside of the vehicle hood. A sample of the label is shown below.

California dealers are now required to issue a proof  of correction certificate to vehicle owners 
upon completion of emissions related recall work. Please fill out one of the campaign 
completion forms for each owner that has this  campaign performed. Inst ruct owners to keep 
this certificate unless they are requested to mail it to the DMV. A sample of the form is shown 
in Figure 2 below.

This is the stop line to utilize when drilling the hole larger. 
 
b. Enlarge the hole until the red line 
is on top of the SCR outlet. 
 
IMPORTANT:  Limit the drill depth to 
1” to prevent damage to the internal structure of the SCR catalyst. Do NOT let the red line go into the SCR 
catalyst outlet. 
11. Deburr the hole drilled into the SCR 
catalyst outlet. 
 
 Use a suitable small round file, 
deburring tool, or 100-150 grit sandpaper to deburr the drilled hole. 
 
IMPORTANT:  Limit the filing depth to 
1” to prevent damage to the internal structure of the SCR catalyst.

 13. Install the tailpipe to the SCR catalyst 
outlet. 
 
a. Line up the cut-out on the tailpipe 
with the alignment tab on the

(20691-EZ41A) on the PM Sensor bracket (22795-EZ41A) as shown in Figure 26. 
 
a. Place the exhaust gasket onto 
the PM Sensor bracket with the hole centered over the bracket 
pilot. 
 
b. Carefully mash the exhaust 
gasket down so it conforms to the 
curvature of the bracket. 
 
c. Make sure the bracket pilot is 
protruding through the gasket. 
16. Place the PM Sensor bracket with 
gasket onto the SCR catalyst outlet at the drilled hole.

Reprogram ECM 
 
 
HINT: 
 
 Most instructions for reprogramming with CONSULT-III plus (C-III plus) are 
displayed on the CONSULT PC screen. 
 
 If you are not familiar with the reprogramming procedure, click here . This will link 
you to the "CONSULT-III PLUS REPROGRAMMING FOR ENGINE OR 
TRANSMISSION CONTROL MODULE (ECM  OR TCM)" general procedure. 
 
 For the Titan XD Diesel, the GR8 set to ECM power supply mode can be 
attached to either 12 volt battery. 
 
 
 
 
Perform the following before st arting the reprogramming proc edure to prevent damage to  
the control unit. 
 Connect the AC Adapter  to the CONSULT PC. 
 
 Connect the CONSULT PC to the VI3 via USB cable. 
 
 Ensure ASIST on the CONSULT PC has  been synchronized (updated) to the 
current date and all CONSULT software updates (if any) have been installed. 
 
HINT:   
 
 When reprogramming is complete, you will be required to perform DTC Erase . 
 
 Turn OFF all external Bluetooth® devices (e.g., cell phones,  printers, etc.) within 
range   of the CONSULT PC and the VI. If Bluetooth® signal waves are within range 
of the CONSULT PC or VI during reprogramming, the reprogramming may be 
interrupted. 
 
 Turn the hazard warning lamps ON. 
 
o Turn OFF all other vehicle electrical loads such as exterior lights, interior lights, 
HVAC, blower, rear defogger, audio, NAV I, seat heater, steering wheel heater, 
etc. If electrical loads rema in ON, the ECM may be damaged. 
 
 Connect a battery maintainer  or smart charger, set to reflash mode or a similar 
setting, to ensure the battery volt age stays between 12.0 V and 13.5 V.

64. Return to the C-III plus Home screen.   65. Turn the ignition ON with the engine OFF (engine not running). 
  66. Confirm the plus VI is recognized.

68. Confirm if ECM reprogramming applies: 
 
a. Find the ECM Part Number and write it on the repair order.  
 
HINT:  This is the current ECM Part Number (P/N). 
 
 
Figure 69 
  
A.  
b. Compare the P/N you wrote down to the numbers in the CURRENT ECM PART 
NUMBER  column in Table A  below. 
 
 
 If there is a match, continue with the reprogra mming procedure. 
 
 If there is not a match, r eprogramming is not needed; skip to CLAIMS 
INFORMATION  on the last page.
