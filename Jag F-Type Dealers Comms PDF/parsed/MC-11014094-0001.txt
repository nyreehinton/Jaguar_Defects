Case Number:  S2521000001  
 
 
Release Date:  February 2025  
 
 
Symptom/Vehicle Issue: Clutch Overheat, And/Or  Service Transmission Illuminated. 
Diagnostic Trouble Code (DTC) P08A6 – Gear Lever Position Sensor System – 
Multiple Sensor Correlation, Set  Only In 4Low . 
 
 
Discussion : Some customers may experience a Clutch Overheat, and/or Service 
Transmission message illumination. This condition will only happen when the vehicle is 
in 4Low. At times, DTC P08A6 may be set in the Powertrain Control Module (PCM). 
This may also affect mostly the Mojave trim package.  
 
If you have a vehicle with the above condition, verify that  the concern can only be 
duplicated by operating the vehicle in 4Low . If so, v erify that the Transfer Case internal 
gearing has not been modified in any way. An internal  transfer case  gearing change  
from factory, will cause this issue.  
 
If the transfer case has not been modified and the concern can only be duplicated 
when operating the vehicle in 4Low, do not replace any parts at this time as it will not 
resolve the issue. This condition is currently under investigation for a possible software 
concern. There is currently no ETA on a fix at this time.
