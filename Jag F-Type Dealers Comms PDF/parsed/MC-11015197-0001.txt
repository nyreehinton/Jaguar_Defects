Page 2 of 2Technical Background 
  A software bug in the Gateway leads to the misdiagnosis of the aforementioned fault code and sets the fault code   
 each time the ignition is switched off. 
 As of All-wheel drive control unit (AWD CU) software version 1301, fault code U12B600 does not force the above   
 yellow warning in the cluster or any white assistance system warnings.
Service Information 
 1. Check the AWD CU software version and ensure that it is at version 1301 or newer. If necessary and   
  applicable, please update the AWD CU to software version 1301 or newer.

   Network VR14 . Please ensure this campaign is completed before performing any further diagnosis.

  other diagnosis.
