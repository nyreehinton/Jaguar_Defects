To whom it may concern:  
 
Bridgestone has identified a labeling  and digital specification error affecting four  product lines: Firestone 
Transforce HT3 , Firestone Transforce CV2 , Bridgestone Dueler LX , and Firestone Destination LE3 . These tires 
have a paper label that incorrectly includes the Three Peak Mountain Snowflake (3PMSF) designation – see 
example below. The digital tire specification information provided to the dealers also contained this error . 
The error is confined to the paper label s and digital specifications only ; the sidewall markings  and 
sales materials  accurately represent the tires' capabilities . 
 
While Bridgestone is correcting this issue moving forward, some mislabeled tires have been shipped to 
dealers and distribution centers  and remain in the network . Actions to be taken:  
 
• When communicating the capabilities of these tires to customers, the information on the tire 
sidewall takes precedence over any other communication.  
• Do not convey that these tires have the 3PMSF designation .  
• Update any digital  materials including  website s to ensure the 3PMSF designation is removed.  
 
In recognition that there may be customers who intentionally purchased one of these tire lines expressly 
because it was designated  with 3PMSF  on the paper label or in dealer materials , Bridgestone is offer ing a 
goodwill adjustment.   The goodwill adjustment will provide a credit towards the purchase of a replacement 
set of tires based on remaining tread depth of the existing tires.   You are encouraged to have the consumer 
call our warranty hotline to receive an authorization number, which you can use when submitting the tire to 
Bridgestone under the existi ng warranty process.     
 
Please call our warranty hotline (800 -847-3272) with any questions .
