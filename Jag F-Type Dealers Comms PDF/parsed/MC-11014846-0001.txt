 SUBJECT: Safety Recall – ODS Sensor Replacement
Subaru of America, Inc. (Subaru) has initiated a safety recall for certain 2020-2022 model year 
Legacy and Outback vehicles to replace all (four) of the Occupant Detection System (ODS) sensors 
on the front passenger seat.
Description of the Defect and Safety Risk
The affected vehicles may be equipped with defective ODS sensors on the front passenger seat, 
which over time may result in a short circuit. If the short circuit occurs, the SRS airbag system 
warning lamp will illuminate, the front passenger’s frontal airbag OFF indicator will illuminate, and 
the front passenger airbag may not deploy in certain crashes as designed, increasing the risk of injury 
to an occupant in the seat.
Remedy
Subaru is in the process of obtaining parts for this repair, however, it will take several months for 
supply to begin. Once parts are available, for all potentially affected vehicles, Subaru retailers will 
replace all (four) of the ODS sensors on the front passenger seat with new ones at no cost to the 
customer.
Affected Vehicles
A total of 118,723 U.S. vehicles will be affected by this recall, as listed below. Not all vehicles in the 
production range listed below are affected by this recall. Coverage must be confirmed by using the

Continued...Retailer Responsibility
Please be advised that it is a violation of Federal law for a dealer to deliver a new motor vehicle 
covered by a recall under a sale or lease until the defect is remedied. Therefore, any Authorized 
Subaru Retailer failing to perform the applicable service procedures to correct all affected 
vehicles in their inventory prior to the vehicle being placed in service may be subject to civil 
penalties of up to $27,168 per violation (i.e., for each vehicle), as provided in 49 CFR §578.6 
and will also be in breach of the Subaru Dealer Agreement.
Any vehicles listed in any recall/campaign that are in retailer stock must be:
• Immediately identified
• Tagged or otherwise marked to prevent their delivery or use prior to repair
• Repaired in accordance with the repair procedures outlined in the Product Campaign Bulletin 
once the parts become available.
Until the recall remedy parts are available, this recall cannot be performed. If an affected vehicle is 
in for service without a confirmed ODS sensor failure, please inform the owner that their vehicle is 
affected by this recall and that remedy parts are not yet available.
If an affected vehicle is in for service with a confirmed ODS sensor failure, there is a limited 
supply of seat bottom assemblies which include the ODS sensors to remedy the condition. Please 
refer to the interim diagnosis procedures and special claim instructions included in the Service, 
Parts, and Claim Instructions section of this document.
Owner Notification
Subaru will notify affected vehicle owners with an interim letter by first class mail by May 21, 2024

Re: WRA-24 ODS Sensor Replacement FAQs, Used Vehicle Inventory & CPO
_________________________________________________________________________________
As we begin phased owner notification for the WRA-24 ODS Sensor Replacement recall, 
we have updated the list of frequently asked questions and the instruction on how to 
handle CPO and Used Vehicle Inventory affected by WRA-24. Please refer to this document 
as a consistent means of communicating with customers.
Frequently Asked Questions
1. Question: What is an Occupant Detection System (ODS)?
Answer: The Occupant Detection System determines the occupant’s presence and 
status in the passenger seat to enable or disable the passenger side airbag from 
deployment in an accident.
2. Question: What is the reason for the recall?
Answer: Vehicles affected by this recall may be equipped with defective Occupant 
Detection System (ODS) sensors on the front passenger seat. If the defect exists, a 
short circuit of the ODS sensors may occur, causing the SRS airbag system warning 
lamp to illuminate. At the same time, the front passenger’s airbag OFF indicator will also 
illuminate, indicating that the front passenger airbag may not deploy in certain crashes 
as designed, increasing the risk of injury to an occupant in the seat.
3. Question: Does this recall affect all 2020-2022 MY Legacy and Outback models?
Answer: No. Not all 2020-2022 MY Legacy and Outback models are affected by this 
recall. Coverage will be confirmed by using the Vehicle Inquiry function on  
Subarunet.com. A total of 118,723 U.S vehicles have been affected by this recall. 
Vehicles not included in the recall are equipped with ODS sensors using a printed  
circuit board (PCB) that is not affected under this recall.
4. Question: What is the recall remedy?
Answer: Subaru retailers will replace all four of the ODS sensors on the front passenger 
seat with new ones at no cost to the customer.
5. Question: When will customer notifications begin?
Answer: Subaru previously notified all affected vehicle owners of this recall with an 
interim letter by first class mail on May 17, 2024, advising them they would be re-
notified with a follow up letter to schedule an appointment once parts became available. 
Subaru is currently receiving a limited number of ODS sensors and hardware kits to 
remedy this recall. To maximize completions of the recall while preventing a potential 
stock-out situation, Subaru will re-notify affected vehicle owners in small, controlled 
phases as described below:

Estimated Q3 2026 21-22 Outback (power passenger seat)
Estimated Q4 2026 21-22 Outback (power passenger seat)
We will update you on timing of owner notification letters for subsequent phases as 
inventory of the remedy parts continues to arrive.
6. Question: As the owner notification phases occur, how will a retailer know 
whether a WRA-24 recall can be performed on an affected vehicle?
Answer: As each owner notification for each phase is announced, the recall status for 
the vehicles included in the phase will change from “Open-Remedy not available” to 
“Open”. Retailers can perform the WRA-24 recall on any vehicle showing an “Open” 
status when running a VIN Inquiry on Subarunet.
NOTE: The phasing schedule plan is based on the number of vehicles in each phase 
and the expected parts inventory. To ensure we are able to efficiently phase this recall 
as planned, it is imperative that retailers do not perform the WRA-24 recall on any 
vehicle where the recall status is “Open- Remedy Not available”.
If you encounter an affected vehicle in an “Open-Remedy not yet available” status and the 
customer is experiencing illumination of the SRS light, please refer to question 9, scenario 
2 for additional information.
If you encounter an affected vehicle that is eligible to be certified in the CPO program, 
please refer to the “Procedure to CPO vehicles affected by the WRA-24 recall” section 
below.
If you encounter an affected vehicle in your used vehicle inventory that does not qualify for 
the CPO Program, please refer to the “Used Vehicle Inventory Process” section below.
7. Question: What is the repair procedure for the WRA-24 recall?
Answer: For vehicles with an “Open” WRA-24 status, the recall repairs can be 
performed as outlined in the WRA-24 Recall Bulletin on STIS. The remedy repair will 
involve replacement of the 4 ODS sensors on the passenger side seat, as well as some 
hardware replacement. WRA-24 training videos will also be part of the required learning 
for technicians on STAR-U. Videos of the repair procedures are also embedded in the 
Recall Bulletin on STIS.
If you encounter an affected vehicle in an “Open- Remedy not yet available” status 
and the customer is not experiencing illumination of the SRS light, let the owner know 
that they will receive owner notification when parts are available to perform the remedy 
repair on their vehicle.
Bulletin Number: WRA-24;  Date: 02/03/25         Page 50 of 59
Continued...NOTE: The remedy repair should only be performed on affected vehicles with the 
WRA-24 in an “Open” status.
1. 8.Question: What if a customer vehicle does not have a current failure (no SRS light 
illuminated), but the customer feels unsafe driving the vehicle?
Answer: There is NO risk to the driver of the vehicle; this recall affects only the 
front passenger side air bag. Additionally, a safety risk to the front passenger 
exists only if the SRS light is illuminated. Please reassure the customer that if the 
SRS light is not illuminated, then the ODS sensors are operating as designed and there 
is no need to take any action until Subaru notifies the customer that parts are available. 
IMPORTANT NOTE: Customers are eligible for alternate transportation only if the SRS 
light is illuminated.
If the ODS sensor failure occurs, the SRS light will illuminate. Please refer to question 9 
for additional information.
9. Question: What if a customer vehicle experiences the ODS sensor failure (SRS 
light illuminates)?
Answer: If an ODS sensor failure occurs, the SRS light will illuminate. The customer 
should be instructed that if the SRS light illuminates, then any passenger in the front 
passenger seat should move to the rear seat, and they should avoid using the front 
passenger seat until the vehicle is inspected and repaired by the retailer.
There are a few different scenarios that your retailer can encounter. Please follow the 
instructions based on the relevant scenario:
Scenario 1: WRA-24 vehicle in an “Open” status, regardless of SRS illumination
Please refer to the WRA-24 Recall bulletin on STIS for the repair procedure to replace the 
ODS Sensor Kit and related hardware. The remedy repair should be performed on any 
vehicle with an “Open” status, regardless of whether the SRS light is illuminated.
Scenario 2: WRA-24 vehicle in an “Open Remedy not yet available” status that has 
the SRS light illuminated
Should a customer bring their vehicle in with the SRS light illuminated, and their WRA-24 
recall status is “Open- Remedy not yet available”, the technician should first pull all DTCs.
If DTC B1788 is present, then the ODS sensor failure has occurred and a QMR should 
be submitted. Please click here to navigate to the appendix for specific instructions and 
requirements for QMR submission for this scenario.
If DTC B1788 is not present, then refer to the applicable service manual and perform 
diagnostics, noting all key steps and results. Please click here to navigate to the appendix 
for specific instructions and requirements for QMR submission for this scenario.
Please note, if you encounter an affected vehicle in an “Open- Remedy not yet available” 
status and the customer is not experiencing illumination of the SRS light, let the owner 
know that they will receive owner notification when parts are available to perform the

Continued...remedy repair on their vehicle.
NOTE: The remedy repair should only be performed on affected vehicles with the 
WRA-24 in an “Open” status.
If the vehicle is used inventory or a Certified Pre-owned vehicle, please refer to the 
separate instructions titled “Used Vehicle Inventory Process” or “Procedure to CPO 
vehicles affected by the WRA-24 recall” in this announcement.
Scenario 3: Seat bottom is needed for a non-WRA-24 affected vehicle or an unrelated 
service issue
If the vehicle is not affected by the WRA-24 recall or has an unrelated service issue that 
requires a seat bottom, a QMR is still required to obtain the seat bottom. Please click here 
to navigate to the appendix for specific instructions and requirements for QMR submission 
for this scenario.
Procedure to CPO vehicles affected by the WRA-24 recall
If you have a used vehicle that is affected by the WRA-24 recall and is in an “Open” Status, 
please refer to the Recall bulletin on STIS and perform the remedy repair. The process 
outlined below relates only to used vehicles affected by the WRA-24 recall in an “Open- 
Remedy not yet available” status that will be considered for CPO certification.
To determine CPO eligibility, the retailer must first run a Carfax on the vehicle to ensure the 
vehicle does not have a branded title, the vehicle has not been in a moderate to severe 
accident, and there is no evidence of airbag deployment. If the Carfax report shows 
evidence of any of these, the vehicle is not able to go through CPO certification and the 
retailer should refer to the Used Vehicle Inventory process outlined in this announcement.
If the Carfax report is clean, the retailer should then work through the 152-point Certified 
Pre-Owned Vehicle Inspection Checklist for the vehicle. The retailer should have an 
accompanying repair order for any work that is done on the vehicle to meet the CPO 
certification requirements.
If the retailer determines the vehicle is eligible for CPO certification, but has an open WRA-
24 recall, the retailer should:
• Submit an order for the appropriate seat bottom for the vehicle. There are three seat 
bottom assembly part numbers, depending on model applicability, for the 2020-2022 
MY Legacy and Outback models affected by this recall, and they are listed below. 
When placing the order, the last 8 characters of the VIN must be entered as the PO 
number.

64139AN02B CUSHION AY OCPANTRH
Bulletin Number: WRA-24;  Date: 02/03/25         Page 52 of 59
Continued...• Once the order is placed, the retailer must email the 152-point CPO Inspection 
Checklist, with Section A completed, and the accompanying Repair Order to the 
Parts Information Coordinators (PICs) at Picemail@subaru.com. The subject line 
of the email should include reference to the WRA-24 recall and include the related 
8-digit order number for the appropriate seat bottom for the vehicle (Example: WRA-
24 parts order # 12345678).
Upon receipt of the email, the PICs will review the information and reply to the retailer 
email advising that either the order was released or requesting additional information. 
If the order is released, the retailer should expect to receive the seat bottom within 
2-3 business days. If there is a request for additional information, and there is no 
response from the retailer providing the requested information within 5 business days, 
the order will be cancelled.
Once the retailer receives the part, the WRA-24 recall can be performed on the vehicle and 
a recall claim should be entered using the following guidelines:
Recall Code Labor Operation Description Labor Hours
WRA24 100576 WRA-24 ODS SEAT BOTTOM R&R 0.9
Once the recall claim is approved, the status of the recall for the VIN will change to 
Completed. Timely claim entry is very important to keep the process of CPO certification 
moving forward. Retailers must wait 24 hours after the recall shows completed on the VIN 
before they can systematically begin certifying one of these vehicles via Subarunet.
If your vehicle is a CPO, do not proceed beyond this point, follow the submission 
instructions above. Any questions should be directed to the Parts Information 
Coordinators (PICS) through email Picemail@subaru.com or phone number 866-782-
2782, option 2.
Used Vehicle Inventory Process
If you have a used vehicle that is affected by the WRA-24 recall and is in an “Open” 
Status, please refer to the Recall bulletin on STIS and perform the remedy repair. The 
process outlined below relates only to used vehicles affected by the WRA-24 recall in an 
“Open- Remedy not yet available” status that do not have an SRS light illuminated and 
do not qualify for the CPO program. These vehicles may be delivered to a purchaser if the 
following 2 conditions are met:
1. The vehicle does not have the SRS indicator illuminated, and
2. The selling retailer discloses information about this safety recall to the 
purchaser using the Vehicle Disclosure Form - It is imperative that the purchaser 
is made aware of the open safety recall on the vehicle and signs the Vehicle 
Disclosure Form prior to completing the purchase. The customer must initial the 
Vehicle Disclosure Form to confirm that they received the WRA-24 Subaru Safety 
Recall Information prior to completing their purchase of the vehicle.
Bulletin Number: WRA-24;  Date: 02/03/25         Page 53 of 59
