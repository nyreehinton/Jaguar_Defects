INTRODUCTION 
 
Nissan is conducting this voluntar
y emission s recall campaign on certain specific model 
year 2018-2019 Titan XD vehicles equipped with a diesel engine, to reprogram the Engine 
Control Module (ECM). This service will be performed at no charge to the customer for 
parts or labor.   
IDENTIFICATION NUMBER 
 
Nissan has assigned identificat ion number PD129 to this ca mpaign. This number must 
appear on all communication and documentation of any nature dealing with this campaign
. 
  
DEALER RESPONSIBILITY 
 
It is the dealer’s responsib
ility to check Serv ice COMM or Dealer Business Systems (DBS) 
National Service History for the campaign stat us on each vehicle falling within the range of 
this voluntary emissions recall which for any reason enters the service department. This 
includes vehicles purchased from private parties  or presented by transient (tourist) owners 
and vehicles in a dealer’s inventory.  Federal law requires that new vehicles in dealer 
inventory which are the subject of a safety recall must be corrected prior to sale.  
Failure to do so can result in civil penalties by the Na tional Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration .  While federal law applies only to new vehicles, Nissan strongly 
encourages dealers to correct any used vehicles in  their inventory before they are retailed.

Reprogram ECM 
 
 
HINT: 
 
 Most instructions for reprogramming with CONSULT-III plus (C-III plus) are 
displayed on the CONSULT PC screen. 
 
 If you are not familiar with the reprogramming procedure, click here . This will link 
you to the "CONSULT-III PLUS REPROGRAMMING FOR ENGINE OR 
TRANSMISSION CONTROL MODULE (ECM  OR TCM)" general procedure. 
 
 For the Titan XD Diesel, the GR8 set to ECM power supply mode can be 
attached to either 12 volt battery. 
 
 
 
 
Perform the following before st arting the reprogramming proc edure to prevent damage to  
the control unit. 
 Connect the AC Adapter  to the CONSULT PC. 
 
 Connect the CONSULT PC to the VI3 via USB cable. 
 
 Ensure ASIST on the CONSULT PC has  been synchronized (updated) to the 
current date and all CONSULT software updates (if any) have been installed. 
 
HINT:   
 
 When reprogramming is complete, you will be required to perform DTC Erase . 
 
 Turn OFF all external Bluetooth® devices (e.g., cell phones,  printers, etc.) within 
range   of the CONSULT PC and the VI3. If Bluetooth® signal waves are within 
range of the CONSULT PC or  VI3 during reprogramming,  the reprogramming may 
be interrupted. 
 
 Turn the hazard warning lamps ON. 
 
o Turn OFF all other vehicle electrical loads such as exterior lights, interior lights, 
HVAC, blower, rear defogger, audio, NAV I, seat heater, steering wheel heater, 
etc. If electrical loads rema in ON, the ECM may be damaged. 
 
 Connect a battery maintainer  or smart charger, set to reflash mode or a similar 
setting, to ensure the battery volt age stays between 12.0 V and 13.5 V.
