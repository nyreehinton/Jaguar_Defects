Service Procedure
Important: Service agents must comply with all International, Federal, State, Provincial, and/or Local laws
applicable to the activities it performs under this bulletin, including but not limited to handling, deploying,
preparing, classifying, packaging, marking, labeling, and shipping dangerous goods. In the event of a
conflict between the procedures set forth in this bulletin and the laws that apply to your dealership, you
must follow those applicable laws.
Bulletin No.: 24-NA-155 February, 2025 Page 11
Important: This technical service bulletin (TSB) can only be completed by certified repair facilities who have met all
specific training, tool and equipment requirements pertaining to the vehicle Brand and Model serviced. Repairs must
be performed by a technician who has successfully completed the required training.
Caution: Before downloading the update files, be sure the computer is connected to the internet through a network
cable (hardwired). DO NOT DOWNLOAD or install the files wirelessly. If there is an interruption during programming,
programming failure or control module damage may occur.
• Ensure the programming tool is equipped with the latest software and is securely connected to the data link
connector. If there is an interruption during programming, programming failure or control module damage may
occur.
• Stable battery voltage is critical during programming. Any fluctuation, spiking, over voltage or loss of voltage will
interrupt programming. Install a GM Authorized Programming Support Tool to maintain system voltage. Refer to
www.gmdesolutions.com for further information.  If not available, connect a fully charged 12V jumper or booster
pack disconnected from the AC voltage supply. DO NOT connect a battery charger.
• Follow the on-screen prompts regarding ignition power mode, but ensure that anything that drains excessive
power (exterior lights, HVAC blower motor, etc) is off.
• Please verify that the radio time and date are set correctly before inserting USB drive into vehicle for
programming, otherwise an error will result .
• Clear DTCs after programming is complete. Clearing powertrain DTCs will set the Inspection/Maintenance (I/M)
system status indicators to NO.
Important: The service technician always needs to verify that the VIN displayed in the TLC left side drop down
menu and the top center window match the VIN plate of the vehicle to be programmed prior to using Service
Programming System 2 (SPS2) for programming or reprogramming a module.
• For the TLC application, service technicians need to always ensure that the power mode (ignition) is “ON”
before reading the VIN from the vehicle’s VIN master module and that they do not select a VIN that is already in
the TLC application memory from a previous vehicle.
• If the VIN that shows up in the TLC top center window after correctly reading the VIN from the vehicle does not
match the VIN plate of the vehicle, manually type in the VIN characters from the vehicle VIN plate into the TLC
top center window and use these for programming or reprogramming the subject module with the correct vehicle
VIN and software and/or calibrations.
• The Engine Control Module (ECM) is the master module (for VIP vehicles) that TLC reads to determine the VIN
of the vehicle. If the VIN read from the vehicle by TLC does not match the VIN plate of the vehicle, the ECM
also needs to be reprogrammed with the correct VIN, software and calibrations that match the vehicle’s VIN
plate.
• The Body Control Module (BCM) is the master module (for GEM vehicles) that TLC reads to determine the VIN
of the vehicle. If the VIN read from the vehicle by TLC does not match the VIN plate of the vehicle, the BCM
also needs to be reprogrammed with the correct VIN, software and calibrations that match the vehicle’s VIN
plate.
Caution: Be sure the VIN selected in the drop down menu (1) is the same as the vehicle connected (2) before
beginning programming.
