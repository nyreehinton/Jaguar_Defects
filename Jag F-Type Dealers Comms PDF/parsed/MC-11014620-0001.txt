Diagnostic Tips:
Technicians are to perform the following diagnostic steps:
Conﬁrm that the fuel feed line engine is properly oriented using SI document ID 6085710.
Verify fuel Hz reading and physical sample condition using SI document ID 5908954 and
correct as necessary .
Using SI document ID: 6275090:
Perform a cold engine AFIT test and document results. If the injectors fail AFIT test,
replace suspected injector(s).  T o test a cold engine using the AFIT tool please perform the
following:
      When the screen appears asking if the engine will start and run, select "no".  This will
bypass the 60 second run time eliminating the possibility of the engine or fuel system
warming up so a true cold engine test can be performed.
Perform a hot engine AFIT test and document results.  If the injectors fail AFIT test,
replace suspected injector(s).
Contact T AC if needed to assist in interpreting results.
If the injectors pass AFIT test, review and replace the High Pressure fuel pump and one
way line.
Inspect the catalytic converter for any concerns from an over fueling condition.
After repair please complete a full drive cycle at a minimum test drive of 10 miles and
recheck for concerns.
