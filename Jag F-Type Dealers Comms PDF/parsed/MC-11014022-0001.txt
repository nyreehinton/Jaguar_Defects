 SC-20-076 Overview:  
• Remove original ecab bottom brackets  
• Bond new stud plates to bus floor  
• Install new ecab bottom brackets  
Step 1:  
Power down the bus and perform the Proterra -approved lockout/tagout procedure before  
beginning work.  
 
Remove the driver seat, ecab cover, wheel well box, and any other components necessary to gain 
access to the ecab structure and driver ’s platform, shown below.  
 
Do not remove ecab stanchions.

 SC-20-076 Step 2:  
Using the templates attached to 
this bulletin (pages 13 and 14) 
cut out fiberglass sheets needed 
to bond the stud plate to the bus 
floor.  
Make sure to cut out bolt -holes 
located in the center of the  
templates.  
  
Step 3:  
Position the floor brackets as 
shown and draw an outline 
around each bracket to mark  
the location of where the stud 
plates will be installed.   
Step 4:  
 
Mark the center of the bracket slots onto the bus floor and drill four holes with a diameter of 24 mm 
and a depth of 3 mm. Recessed holes are needed for the stud plates to sit level on the bus floor.  
 
Step 5:  
Wrap the threads of the stud 
plate studs with painter ’s tape to 
protect them from fiberglass  
resin.

 SC-20-076 Step 6:  
Abrade the bonding surfaces 
(top and bottom) of the two stud 
plates (194 -7411) with a 36 -grit 
sanding disc.   
 
Clean the abraded surfaces with  
Isopropyl alcohol then apply  
metal primer (020990).  
 
The properly coated surface will  
have a light pink finish.  
  
Step 7:  
Lightly scuff the bus floor within the area outlined in Step 3 with 36 -grit sanding disc.  
 
Clean abraded surface with isopropyl alcohol to remove dust and debris.  
 
Step 8:  
Apply a generous portion of 
Plexus MA -530 to the  
underside of both stud plates  
(194-7411) and spread out to 
achieve full coverage.   
Step 9:  
Position both stud plates  
(194-7411) onto the floor of the  
bus aligning them with the  
recessed holes drilled in Step 4.  
 
Apply downward pressure to the 
plates until level contact is made 
with the floor.   
    
 

 
 
Page 6 of 14  
 SC-20-076 Step 10:  
Spread the excess Plexus  
material around the stud plate to 
create a smooth transition from 
the stud plate to the floor.   
Step 11:  
Allow 90 minutes for Plexus to fully cure and bond stud plates to bus floor.   
 
Step 12:  
Prepare the resin mix used for 
coating the fiber glass.  
 
Mix Resin and MEKP in the ratio 
as shown until fully blended.  
 
Follow all safety guidance  
provided by chemical  
manufacturers.   
Step 13:  
Apply the resin mixture and install fiberglass sheets.  
 
• Wear gloves and appropriate PPE  
• Place a piece of clean cardboard on a flat surface to be used as a working area  
• Place the Layer 1 fiberglass sheets (84 mm x 122 mm) onto the cardboard and use a paintbrush 
to coat the first side with the resin mixture, brushing from center to outside.  
• Flip-over the Layer 1 sheets and continue coating the other side until fiberglass is fully saturated.  
• Position one of the Layer 1 fiberglass sheets over each of the bonded stud plates (194 -7411)  
• Smooth and flatten the fiberglass sheet, ensuring consistent contact with the bus floor.  
• Apply an additional layer of resin on top of fiberglass after positioning in place.     

 
 
Page 7 of 14  
 SC-20-076 Step 14:  
Apply additional fiberglass layers 
two and three using the same 
process from Step 13 . 
 
After all layers have been  
applied, roll the layers of fiber-
glass flush to the stud plate and 
floor, removing any air  
bubbles.   
Step 15:  
Allow four hours for saturated fiberglass to fully cure.  
When fiberglass has fully hardened and is no longer tacky, clean up any rough edges by lightly  
sanding with 36 -grit sandpaper.  
 
Caution: Do not remove any thickness from the outer layer of fiberglass.  
 
Clean work area and dispose of any un -used resin mixture.  
 
Step 16:  
Fit the ecab floor bracket  
(194-9798) on the stud plate 
(194-7411) and ensure the  
bottom slot is aligned with the 
top bolt hole in the ecab vertical 
stanchion.  
 
Mark the center of the top  
attachment point of the ecab 
bracket.  
 
Remove the bracket and drill a 
hole completely through the  
ecab stanchion with an M10 drill 
bit.

 SC-20-076 Step 17:  
Install the ecab bracket to the 
stud plate and vertical stanchion.  
 
Attach fasteners and torque as 
shown.  
 
Torque stripe M10 and M8 lock-
nuts.  
 
Repeat for other side.  
 
  
Step 18:  
The procedure to install the bottom brackets is now complete.

assembled brackets.  
  
Step 22:  
Attach the assembled bracket to 
the square tubing on the street 
side of the bus with original 
fasteners.  
 
Adjust the bracket for the best fit 
of the stud plate (046644) for 
mounting to the bus body.  
 
Draw an outline of the stud plate 
(046644) onto the bus body 
interior.

 SC-20-076 Step 23:  
Attach stud plate (046644) to the 
original curbside bracket 
(046741) with fasteners.   
Step 24:  
Loosely attach assembled 
bracket to the curbside ecab 
stanchion using the original 
fasteners.  
 
Adjust the bracket for the best fit 
to mount the stud plate to the bus 
body interior wall.  
 
Using a permanent marker, 
outline the stud plate onto the 
bus body interior wall.  
  
Step 25:  
Temporarily remove the assembled brackets from both sides of the vertical ecab stanchions.  
 
Step 26:  
Using a power drill with a 36 -grit sanding disc, lightly scuff the back side of both stud plates (046644) 
and the areas of the interior bus body that were outlined in previous steps.  
Clean the scuffed areas with a shop towel and isopropyl alcohol.  
 
Step 27:  
Apply Plexus Primer (018362) to the scuffed areas on the back of the stud plates (046644).
