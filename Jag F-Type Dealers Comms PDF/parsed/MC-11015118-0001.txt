Condition
 The presence of DME misfire faults P030X00 occurring during catalytic warm-up (or low engine temperatures), 
 under low relative load for the internal combustion engine (ICE), at low ICE rpm (1400 - 3000 rpm). If there is a 
 customer complaint for the check engine light (CEL), then it is likely the Instrument Cluster Fault P162400 (’Engine
 control indicator light switched on’) results from the misfire fault(s). 
 If these conditions are present, it is therefore often possible to reproduce such misfires during catalytic warming of 
 a cold engine as the drivetrain load supported by the electrical motor shifts to the ICE. A CEL requires two sequential
 drive-cycles with entered misfire faults; nonetheless, even when the misfire fault sets for the first time, operation of
 the electric motor (in E-Power or Hybrid Auto mode) suspends indefinitely for that drive cycle.

Page 2 of 3Technical Background
 The misfire diagnostic is sensitive, yet accurate. In some instances, the engine operating conditions during catalytic
 warming may trigger misfire faults. 
 NOTE: Misfire faults can arise for numerous reasons. If the above conditions in the environmental fault data do NOT 
 exist, then the misfire cause requires further root cause diagnosis and remedy.
Service Information
 1.  Please create a VAL to document any fault codes stored in the DME.
 2.  Inspect the environmental data within any of the stored misfire fault codes and observe the engine speed,   
  relative load, and measured engine torque at which the faults occurred. If the three values match the criteria  
  below, then the specific engine operating conditions may be contributing to the misfires:
  --> Engine speed 1300-3000 rpm
  --> Relative load 45-60%
  --> Measured torque 85-90 Nm
 
 3.  If the misfire faults are determined to be caused by the above specific operating conditions during catalytic 
  heating, and no rough running condition is observed, do not replace any parts. A software solution is cur-
  rently being developed to improve engine performance during catalytic heating.
 4.  If the misfire faults occur within the above specific operating conditions during catalytic heating, but rough
  running conditions are observed, please continue with other misfire diagnosis to ensure that there are no   
  other factors contributing to the diagnosed misfires.
