Diagnostic Sheet  
FROM : Maserati TSO      
TO: Maserati Network   
 
 
 
DATE : February  4, 2025 
 
 
This Diagnostic Sheet  serves as a guide and provides additional diagnostic info for possible  MC20 
gearbox  anomalies  and possible lower -level repair now available.  Maserati also introduced a new 
Procedure available through  the MDEVO called  “DCTM Service Fast Learn ”. This  new routine could 
be used to address issues related to sticky valve and performs a purge cycle and a valve 
readaptation to address pressure related issues.  
 
SECTION:  03.10 - 1 GEARBOX HOUSINGS  
 
MODEL:  M240 MC20 & MC20 Cielo from MY23 (on MY22 the DCTM Service Fast Learn procedure is not available 
due to a technical constraint related to DTCM SW version)  
 
CONCERN : Gearbox warning light on and storage in DCTM of one or multiple of the following DTCs.

www.maseratiusa.com  Diagnos tic Action  
 
Please refer to the diagnostic path  belo w: 
 
1) Read DTCs stored in DCTM (save a complete vehicle scan report DTC+ Parameters)  
2) If DTCs stored in DCTM are included in the above table, perform the diagnostic procedure.  
DCTM → Procedures → DCTM Service Fast Learn  
3) Road test the car and check if the complained anomaly and related DTCs could be reproduced.  
• If the anomaly does not appear anymore, replace Gearbox oil and filter, road test again the 
car and in case of good outcome the car could be delivered back to the customer.  
• If the anomaly and DCTM DTCs appear again, save a complete vehicle scan report DTC+ 
Parameters.  
- If DTC stored in DCTM is classified as Type1 (according to the above table), go to Step 4) 
- If DTC stored in DCTM is classified as Type2 (according to the above table), go to Step 5) 
4) Replace Mechatronic Assembly + gearbox Oil and filter (component #54 in table 03.10.1 Gearbox 
housings).  
After installing the new parts, perform again the diagnostic procedure DCTM → Procedures → DCTM 
Service Fast Learn.  
Road test the car and check if the complained anomaly and related DTCs could be reproduced.  
• If the anomaly does not appear anymore, the car could be delivered back to the customer.  
• If the anomaly and DTCs appear again, the complete Gearbox needs to be replaced (save 
a complete vehicle scan report DTC+ Parameters).  
5) Perform and record in pdf an acquisition of below indicated DCTM parameters to identify the causal 
component.  
1F35 - System Pressure Sensor Raw with Zero Correction  
1EFA - System Pressure Sensor Raw  
1F37 - System Pressure Target  
NOTE:  System Pressure should maintain between 20 and 30 bar of pressure when the engine is running 
or driving the car, the “commanded” pressure will vary in this range depending on torque requirements. 
For diagnostics we look for pressure oscillation or frequen t pressure drops below 5 bar indicating the 
system pressure control valve is having trouble maintaining stable pressure.  
• If the System Pressure is stable, the complete Gearbox needs to be replaced.  
• If the System Pressure is unstable, go to Step  4) 
It is required to open a Blue on Line as Support Request by providing evidence and step by step outcome 
of the above indicated diagnosis.  
REPAIR NOTE:  In case of Mechatronic Assembly replacement, only screws PN 673016908 (component #55 
in table 03.10.1 Gearbox housings) they do not necessarily need to be replaced but they can be re 
installed.  
Please do not hesitate to contact us for any questions you may have.
