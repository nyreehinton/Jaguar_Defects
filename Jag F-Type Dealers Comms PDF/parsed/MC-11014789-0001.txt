DESCRIPTION
Some customers may complain about a very low frequency noise and/or vibration felt at the steering wheel, the floor and/
or the seats when driving at 1500-1650 rpm in any gear position. This may be caused by normal vehicle behavior while 
the cylinder deactivation is active (two cylinders drive). The state of the cylinder deactivation can be monitored in the 
center display to help verify if this is the issue.  
 
WARNING:  DO NOT keep your eyes focused solely on the display while test driving. For your safety, keep your eyes on 
the road ahead.  
To correct this concern, the radiator mount brackets and the control software of the PCM have been modified to reduce 
the resonance of the radiator.  
 
NOTE: The combination of the modified radiator mount brackets and older PCM calibration may result in worse vibration.  
 
Customers having this concern should have their vehicle repaired using the following repair procedure.
