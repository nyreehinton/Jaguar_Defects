Introduction  
During the manufacturing process, tires are mounted on the vehicle as matched sets to help 
reduce conditions such as pulling or drifting. If the wheels are replaced or refinished before 
vehicle delivery, it is important that the tires remain on the vehicle in the same location and in 
the same direction of rotation . 
 
Follow the Tire Positioning Procedure in this bulletin to ensure that the original tires stay in the 
same location on the vehicle.
