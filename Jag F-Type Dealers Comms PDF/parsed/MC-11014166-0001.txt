Failure Code RF Required Flash
CC Customer Concern
The dealer must choose which failure code to use depending on if this is a Rapid Service Update
(RSU) or Technical Service Bulletin.
● The “RF” failure code is required for essential module flash/reprogramming and can only be used after
confirmation that the VIN is included on the RSU.
● The failure code “RF” (Required Flash) can no longer be used on Technical Service Bulletin flashes. The
“RF” failure code must be used on an RSU.
● If the customer’s concern matches the SYMPTOM/CONDITION identified in the Technical Service Bulletin,
failure code CC is to be used. When utilizing this failure code, the 3C’s must be supplied.
DIAGNOSIS:
Using a Scan Tool (wiTECH) with the appropriate Diagnostic Procedures available in DealerCONNECT/
Service Library, verify all related systems are functioning as designed. If DTCs or symptom conditions, other
than the ones listed above are present, record the issues on the repair order and repair as necessary before
proceeding further with this bulletin.
If a customer’s VIN is listed in VIP or your RSU VIN list, perform the repair. If any vehicle not on the VIN list
exhibits the DTCs, perform the repair.

● When performing repairs that directly involve or imply possible contact with live high voltage
components/systems, the technician must ensure that the power supply of the high-voltage system
is disconnected throughout the operation.
● Only specifically trained technicians qualified to perform repairs on vehicles with high voltage
systems under current national laws/regulations are authorized to work on the vehicle.
● Before performing any diagnostic repair work on the vehicle, carefully read and comply with
the general instructions for working safely on hybrid/electric vehicles and use suitable general
equipment and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).
● The vehicle must not be connected to a high voltage charger when performing software updates.
NOTE: Install a battery charger to maintain a 12 volt system voltage.
NOTE: If this flash process is interrupted/aborted, the flash should be restarted.
