Subaru Service Bulletins are intended for use by professional technicians ONLY . They 
are written to inform those technicians of conditions that may occur in some vehicles, 
or to provide information that could assist in the proper servicing of the vehicle. Properly 
trained technicians have the equipment, tools, safety instructions, and know-how to 
do the job correctly and safely. If a condition is described, DO NOT assume that this 
Service Bulletin applies to your vehicle, or that your vehicle will have that condition.Subaru of America, Inc. is

ISO 14001 is the international standard 
for excellence in Environmental 
Management Systems. Please recycle 
or dispose of automotive products in a

and in accordance with all local, state 
and federal laws and regulations.INTRODUCTION:
This Service Bulletin provides additional diagnostics to follow when addressing a Telematics-related 
DTC B2A16.  In most cases involving this DTC, the following scenario(s) occur:
• When trying to use the remote engine starter (RES) feature through Telematics (STARLINK 
/ My Subaru app) the request is unsuccessful and the red Telematics indicator lamp 
illuminates.
• The customer takes their vehicle to the Retailer and the Technician finds the only code stored 
to be B2A16 in the DCM.
• The Technician diagnoses the DTC per the applicable Service Manual trouble tree and 
replaced the DCM.
IMPORTANT:  Nearly all of the scenarios outlined above can be addressed and normal RES 
operation through the Telematics system restored WITHOUT replacement of the DCM.  SBR will 
be updating the applicable Service Manuals to reflect this very soon.  In the interim, refer to the 
diagnostic procedure outlined in this bulletin.

REMINDER:  Customer satisfaction and retention starts with performing quality repairs.
IMPORTANT:  Nearly all of the scenarios outlined above can be addressed and normal RES 
operation through the Telematics system restored WITHOUT replacement of the DCM.  SBR will be 
updating the applicable Service Manuals to reflect this very soon.
If DTC B2A16 is found in the DCM, start by registering the DCM with the vehicle immobilizer 
system to avoid a potentially unnecessary DCM replacement.  Follow the instructions found in 
the applicable Immobilizer Registration Manual.  See the basic SSM screenshots and additional 
information provided below for reference. 
Once the DCM is registered, confirm the Telematics RES function operates.  NOTE:  The customer 
will need to help with this as it requires them to enter their PIN through either the MySubaru web 
page or the mobile MySubaru App.
If registering the DCM with the vehicle immobilizer system resolves the condition and STARLINK 
Telematics RES now operates normally, clear the DTC and release the vehicle.
NOTE:  When selecting G, H, or I Type, the latest SSM4 software (July 2019 version or later) is 
required along with a secure network connection.  Refer to TSB 15-246-19 for additional details.

IMPORTANT:  Whenever either the Keyless Access Module (KAM) or the DCM is replaced on 
a STARLINK Gen2 Telematics -equipped vehicle, the DCM MUST be registered with the vehicle 
immobilizer system.
Always refer to the applicable Immobilizer Registration Manual for the Model Year vehicle being 
repaired.  These manuals can be found on STIS by searching Online Publications > Publication Type 
> Other/Miscellaneous and searching with the keyword “Immobilizer”.
