Parking and Paint Protection Procedure  
 Storage areas should  be paved, well lit, and secur e. If your off-site storage lot is NOT  paved, 
spread  gravel to minimi ze mud and dust.  Make  sure vehicles  are driven carefully  when 
moving them  to or from a long-term lot. This will help minimi ze damage  to the paint  finish 
from road grit or gravel. 
 Park vehicles  from right to left AT LEAST  three  feet apart. Leave enough space  front and 
rear to easily  walk between rows. 
 Turn OFF ALL elect rical accesso ries, make sure windows and sunroof are  closed,  and 
check that the  transmission  is in Park (First  or Reverse for manual transmission  vehicles).  
Do NOT apply  the parking brake. Ensure vehicles with electronic parking brakes D o NOT 
engage , and the Auto function has been DISABLED ( refer to the Owner ’s Manual for details) . 
 Make sure the plastic  door edge  protectors  are in place  and fold in the side view mirror  
(if applica ble). 
 Anti-rust covers or anti-rust film should  remain  on vehicle  during storage. 
1. Anti-rust covers (behind  wheel)  should  be removed at PDS. 
2. Anti-rust film (applied  to wheel)  should  be removed just prior to customer  delivery. 
 Wash vehicles  frequentl y. For further guidance and detail, refer to L-SB-0024 -24.

12V Battery  Maintenance   
 If a vehicle  is put into storage, the SOC of  its 12V battery will gradually  decreas e. To prevent 
the 12V battery from becoming  discharged du ring storage, proper  maintenance  is necessa ry.  
 To reduce  batte ry drain during long-term storage, remove the batte ry ground  (–) cable of each 
vehicle  and reinstall  it just before delivery to the custome r. When the battery ground ( –) cable  
is reconnected, check  and reset electrical components, such as the clock, radio, etc., and 
reinitialize ALL applicable systems/functions. Refer to the applicable Repair Manual for 
complete details:  Repair Manual – General – Introduction – Repair Instruction  – Precaution . 
 After 60 days, and every 30 days thereafter, inspect the 12V battery with the DSS-5000 or 
DCA -8000 battery diagnostic tool. If charging is required, use the DCA -8000. Refer to the 
DSS-5000 Instruction Manu al and/or DCA -8000 Instruction Manual  for complete battery  
maintenance procedures.  
 When removing the vehicle from storage, connect the negative ( –) terminal. Refer to the 
applicable Repair Manual for torque specifications : Repair Manual – General – 
Maintenance – Battery – Installation . 
 
  NOTE  
 BEFORE disconnecting the 12V battery, confirm the shift lever is in the “P” position. The shift lever 
CANNOT be shifted from the “P” position with the 12V battery disconnected.  
 If the negative ( –) terminal of the 12V battery is reconnected on electrified models, even if the 
vehicle is powered ON (Ready ON), the hybrid system may NOT start. In this case, depress the 
brake pedal, open and close any of the doors, and  press the Power button to start the hybrid 
system (the Ready light is ON). If the hybrid system still does NOT start (the Ready light is OFF), 
refer to the applicable model and model year Repair Manual.

HV Battery Charging (HEV/PHEV Models)  
HEV/PHEVs store electricity in the HV battery. When the vehicle is not used for a period of 30 
days or more, the HV battery may discharge, thus reducing vehicle travel range. To prevent the 
HV battery from fully discharging it is necessary to maintain the charge level of the HV battery.  
 
Charging the HV Battery  
1. Park the vehicle in open air or connect the 
exhaust extraction hose to the exhaust pipe.  
2. Apply the parking brake.  
3. With the brake pedal depressed, select the 
power switch to the “START” mode, and 
check that the “READY” light in the 
combination meter illuminates when the 
hybrid system starts (the “READY” light  
is ON).  
4. Turn OFF all lights and accessories.  
5. Check that the shift lever is in the  
“P” position.  
6. Keep the “READY” light ON and charge the 
HV battery for 30 minutes.   Figure  1. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  NOTE  
 If the amount  of charging energy is small,  the display may NOT indicate  the energy flow. 
 Ensure  there  is a sufficient  amount  of fuel for the vehicle to run for 30 minutes.  
HINT  
The HV battery can also be charged by driving the vehicle for 30 minutes.

HV Battery Charging (BEV Models)  
BEVs  store electricity received via an external power source in the HV battery. When the BEV is 
not used for a period of 30 days or more, the HV battery may discharge, thus reducing vehicle 
travel range. To prevent the HV battery from fully discharging it is necessary to maintain the 
charge level of the HV battery.   
 
1. If the warning light is displayed ON within the instrument cluster, charge the HV battery via 
the AC charging method.

Tire Inflation Pressure  
If the vehicle is  parked for long periods without being  moved, a flat spot may develop on each 
tire surface in contact  with the ground,  even  if the tires are inflated  to specification.  Tire inflation 
pressure  should  be checked  once  a month.  
 
Tire inflation  pressure  for storage ONLY : 43 psi. 
 
 
Parts Rust Inspection  
If the vehicles  in your storage area are exposed  to a sea breeze and/or  significant  precipitation, 
corrosion  with rust in some  parts may occu r. If rust is found,  remove it, and  treat it by applying  
rust inhibitor  to prevent recurrenc e. 
 
RapGard ™ Protective Film Removal  
RapGard ™ is a protective film designed to protect horizontally painted surfaces from acid rain, 
environmental fallout, and rail contamination. For additional detail and removal instruction, refer 
to L-SB-0021 -24, Rapgard™ Protective Film Removal.   
 
 
Engine/Hybrid System Starting and Vehicle Movement  
If the vehicle is stored over an extended period of time, starting and running the engine/hybrid 
system periodically will ensure smooth running operation.  
1. If the vehicle is equipped  with a gasoline  engin e, start and operate the engine  at an engine 
speed of  less than 1,500 rpm for 15 minutes or longe r.  
2. Raise engine  speed  above 3,000  rpm 10 times  to eliminate  moisture  from the exhaust.  
 
 
 
 
 
3. Drive  the vehicle AT LEAST  30 feet to lubricate  the transmission/t ransaxle  and differential(s), 
and to prevent tire flat-spot damag e. 
  NOTE  
Tire pressure may vary due to changes in ambient temperatures and may require adjustment.  
NOTE  
Make sure  to allow sufficient  clearance  at the rear of the vehicle to prevent other  vehicles stored 
behind  from getting  damaged by exhaust  gas.
