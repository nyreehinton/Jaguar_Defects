ConditionSome customers ma y comment on a "Service Door Latch
System" message.
CauseThe cause of this concern could be that the rear child

Correction:
-  On Cadillac and Chevrolet models, try to resync the rear door child safety
locks by opening all doors and leave open.  Then go into the radio displa y and
cycle the child safety locks on and oﬀ.  There are two diﬀerent areas, within
the radio, where the Child Safety Locks can be cycled on and oﬀ.  It is
important that you are at the screen shown above or it will not cycle the child
safety lock actuators and show it is greyed out.  T o get to this screen go to the
radio displa y home screen > select Controls > See More Controls > Doors &
Windows > Child Safety Locks > On and Oﬀ.  This will cycle both rear door child
safety lock actuators, which if out of sync will bring them back into sync with
each other and clear the message.
If cycling the child safety locks on and oﬀ does NOT correct the concern, use
GDS2 and go into the BCM> Data Displa y > V ehicle Access Data and monitor
the following two parameters:  Right Rear Child Security Lock - Lock Command
and the Left Rear Child Security Lock - Lock Command to see if they both are
synced with each other .  Here are some reasons that the rear child safety
locks ma y not be synced with each other:   
1.  An issue with the feedback circuits 3269 or 3268, see example doc ID
6614043.
2.  A fault with the child safety lock actuator circuits 3266, 2679, 2680, see
example SI doc ID 6614044.   
3.  For more information, please follow normal SI diagnostics for "Power Door
Child Lock Malfunction". 
After the fault is found and corrected then cycle the Child Safety lock feature
on and oﬀ to resync and clear the service door latch message. 
NOTE:  The child safety lock feature will not operate properly IF there is
preload on the door latch from the inside door handle/cable. This could be
caused by the inside door handle cable being
misinstalled/binding/kink ed/etc causing a slight preload on the door latch.  This
slight preload from the cable ma y not allow the child safety locks to move when
being cycled on and oﬀ.  
 
 - On GMC models, unlik e the Cadillac and Chevrolet models, when cycling the
Child Safety Locks On and Oﬀ it is not actually cycling the child safety lock
actuators, and because of that it will not bring a door mismatch back into sync.
  Use GDS2 and go into the BCM> Data Displa y > V ehicle Access Data and
monitor the following two parameters:  Right Rear Child Security Lock - Lock
Command and the Left Rear Child Security Lock - Lock Command to see if both
rear door child locks show to be synced with each other and if so skip to step
4.  If not, then listed below are some reasons the rear door child locks ma y be
out of sync with each other:  
1.  Previous repair work to a door , door panel, or a latch which was
disconnected or replaced could cause the left and right rear door child lock
actuators to become out of sync with each other .  If this were to occur one
additional symptom that would be noticed, in addition to the GDS2 parameters
showing them out of sync,  is that one rear door would open from the inside
door handle and the other rear door will not open from the inside door handle.
 To resync both rear door child lock actuators, pick one of the rear doors
and disconnect the door connector (X700 or X800).  Next, manually provide
momentary power and ground to the child lock actuator circuits 3266 and 2679
or 2680 to the door side of the connector , example SI doc ID 6615130. 
Providing power and ground one wa y will enable the child lock and reversing
the leads will disable the child locks.  Mak e sure to use a 1 amp fused jumper
lead and jumper the child lock actuator so it matches the opposite side door .
 When completed properly both rear doors will operate the same from the
inside door handles (either enabled or disabled) and the GDS2 data parameters
listed above will be synced/match.    
2.  An issue with the child lock feedback circuits 3269 or 3268, see example doc
ID 6615129  
3.  An issue with the child lock actuator circuits 3266, 2679, 2680 see example
SI doc ID 6615130.    
For more information, please follow normal SI diagnostics for "Power Door Child
Lock Malfunction".

slight preload from the cable ma y not allow the child safety locks to move when

4.  Once both rear doors operate the same from the inside door handles (both
rear doors will open or not open from the inside door handles, must be the
same) and the GDS2 parameters Right Rear Child Security Lock - Lock
Command and the Left Rear Child Security Lock - Lock Command both indicate
each rear door is synced to each other , then if the "Service Door Latch System"
message is still displa yed the BCM will need to be replaced.  The reason the
BCM needs to be replaced is only to clear the message and nothing more.  In
the future, the GMC will clear the message when the child door locks are cycled
on and oﬀ, lik e the Chevy and Cadillac models.  
NOTE:  Do not replace the BCM until both rear doors are synced.
