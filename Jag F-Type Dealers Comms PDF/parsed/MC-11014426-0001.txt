Some 2025 Maverick vehicles may exhibit diagnostic trouble code (DTC) U053B:56 in the instrument panel
cluster (IPC). This may be due to the software within the image processing module A (IPMA) resulting in this
DTC setting in the IPC. If this DTC is identified but the vehicle does not exhibit any customer symptoms,
replacement or reprogramming of the IPC will not resolve this condition at this time. Engineering is currently
working on a solution and a software update is expected in Q4 2025. Monitor Professional Technician System
(PTS) for additional information and schedule service appointments for customers once the repair becomes
available.
