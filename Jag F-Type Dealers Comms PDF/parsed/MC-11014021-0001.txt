Condition
5645798
Some customers may comment on noticing anywhere from 2 –10 mm (0.08 – 0.4 in.)
vertical misalignment of the body feature line between the cab and the pickup box, on the
driver's side of vehicle.
Cause The cause of the condition may be pickup box structure variation.
CorrectionRealign the left side of the cab and install shim washers, following the steps in the
Service Procedure below.
 
Service Procedure
Important: Service agents must comply with all International, Federal, State, Provincial, and/or Local laws
applicable to the activities it performs under this bulletin, including but not limited to handling, deploying,
preparing, classifying, packaging, marking, labeling, and shipping dangerous goods. In the event of a
conflict between the procedures set forth in this bulletin and the laws that apply to your dealership, you
must follow those applicable laws.

1. Verify the condition by visually checking, and measuring, the body feature line variance, on the left side of the
vehicle.
Bulletin No.: 20-NA-175 January, 2025 Page 3
2. Raise and support the vehicle. Refer to Lifting and Jacking the Vehicle  in SI.

3. Remove the 3 left side body mount bolts and washers (1).

Note: For trucks with running boards, the jack can be positioned below the running board bracket. For trucks without
running boards, position the jack below the cab pinch weld and use a wood block to protect the paint, and sheet
metal.
4. Using a jack stand (1), raise the cab high enough to achieve enough clearance to install the shim washers
between the body of the truck and the top of each body mount.
5. Install shim washers to each body mount location(s) as needed.
Note: Typically, it will take 2 shim washers in the rear mount to get a 10 mm adjustment in height at the body line. If
more than one washer shim is installed on the rear body mount, you will need to put a single shim washer on the
mount at the B-Pillar.
Important: We should never install more than 2 shim washers in the rear to make the alignment, one will get roughly
5 mm at the box/cab and two will get roughly 10 mm at box/cab interface.
6. Remove the jack stand from the cab.

7. Perform the following procedure before installing the body mount bolts (1).
7.1. Remove all traces of any of the original adhesive patch from the bolt threads.
7.2. Clean the threads of the bolts with denatured alcohol, or equivalent, and allow to dry.
Bulletin No.: 20-NA-175 January, 2025 Page 5
7.3. Apply Threadlocker to the body mount bolts.

8. Re-torque the 3 left side body mount bolts.
Tighten.
Tighten the bolts to 165 Nm (122 lb. ft).
9. Remove the support and lower the vehicle.
10. Verify that the cab alignment condition has been eliminated.
