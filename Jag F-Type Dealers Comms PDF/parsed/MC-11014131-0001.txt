SERVICE:
This issue could result from the TCAM going offline during abandon mode due to a low State of 
Charge (SoC) detected on the 12V battery. 
Low SoC for 12V= SoC is less than 55% for 3 minutes, or less than 40% for 1 minute.
For reference, it is the same level of SoC that triggers the infotainment “warning message” when 
listening to music with the vehicle powered off.  
To avoid unnecessary fault tracing and repairs the suggestion is to:
• Ensure that the 12 V battery is fully charged.
• Check the Volvo Cars app after the car has been parked for 2 hours. If the symptom is gone, then 
the cause is most likely due to a low 12V battery State of Charge (SoC).
• If the symptom is repeated frequently, then fault trace the 12 V system according to VIDA.
Note! The “Vehicle offline” message can be displayed in the Volvo cars app if the app does not 
have connectivity to the cloud or the car is parked in a bad network area, for example underground 
parking.
