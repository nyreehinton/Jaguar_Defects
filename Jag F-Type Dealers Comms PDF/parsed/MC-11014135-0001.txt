SUBJECT:  HIGH PRESSURE FUEL PUMP REPLACEMENT  
(WARRANTY EXTENSION  Z04) 
 
Description:  Certain 2019- 2022MY Veloster N (JSN), 2022- 2023MY Elantra N (CN7N), and  
2022- 2023MY Kona N (OSN) vehicles are equipped with high pressure fuel pump (HPFP) assemblies 
that have fuel control valves (FCV) that could allow excess fuel to enter the fuel pump due to gradual 
wear of the FCV plunger. An air/fuel mixture that runs too “rich” may result in a reduction or loss of 
motive power at low speeds. The vehicle will also have Diagnostic Trouble Code (DTC) P0088. 
  
Hyundai is extending warranty coverage for the HPFP under this condition to 15 years or 150,000 miles 
from the date of original retail delivery or date of first use (whichever occurs first) and is valid for original 
and subsequent owners.  
  
Follow the service procedure in this TSB to replace the HPFP.
