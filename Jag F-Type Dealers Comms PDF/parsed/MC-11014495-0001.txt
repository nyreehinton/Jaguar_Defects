Release notes  Certain vehicles may have a Brake System 
Control Module (BSCM) that does not 
correctly set a Diagnostic Trouble Code (DTC) 
or illuminate the Malfunction Indicator Lamp 
(Check Engine Light) if certain system faults 
with the potential to affect the vehicle’s  
emissions control system were to 
occur.   Dashboard warning messages and 
warning lights for traction control, stability 
control, and brake system would remain 
functional in the event that a fault that could 
potentially impact drivability is detected. This 
update will complete the remedy for GM 
Recall No. N232428991 and no additional 
steps are needed after a successful update. 
You will also receive a letter providing 
additional details regarding this issue.  
 
During the update process, your radio may 
stay on up to 5 minutes after you exit the 
vehicle. This is expected behavior when an 
update package is onboard the vehicle. Do 
not service your vehicle during installation.
