Correction:  
It is advisable to remove the protective wrap as soon as possible after the vehicle is delivered. 
The vehicle should be placed inside and allowed to reach room temperature before removal. 
Once the wrap is removed if the vehicle is parked in the sun the marks will normally disappear
within 2-3 hours. 
After removing the dirt from the area, application of 91% Isopropyl alcohol will assist in
drawing out the moisture.  
If it is not possible to park the vehicle in the sun or the marks have not cleared up a heat lamp
or heat gun can be used. 
Place a halogen heat lamp near the area to draw the moisture out. LED lamps will not produce
enough heat. 
If using a heat gun take care not to overheat the area, hold the heat gun about 3" from the
surface and use a circular motion over the aﬀected area until the marks are gone.
