Installation Procedure: Pre -Installed Knob Style  
 
1. Verify that the driver , and if applicable, passenger side , and rear seat floor mats are for the  
correct model and model year vehicle they are being installed in.  
  NOTICE  
If the vehicle is equipped with two sets of floor mats (carpet and all weather):  
• Do NOT install both sets of floor mats at the same time.  
• Install one set according to the current season and store the other set in the  
luggage  compartment.  
• Discard the Floor Mat Safety Check  insert for the installed set and keep the other with the  
spare floor mat set for the customer’s reference.  CAUTION  
• ALWAYS verify the floor mat is designed specifically for the model and model year it is being 
installed in.  
• ONLY use floor mats that can be secured using the retainers. ALL OEM Toyota floor mats are 
specifically designed to fit correctly and be secured using the retainers.  
• Make sure the floor mat is properly placed on the vehicle carpet and secured with the 
retainers. If the driver side floor mat is NOT properly placed and secured, it could slip and 
interfere with the movement of the pedals during driving and may cause an ac cident.  
• Verify the operation of the accelerator, brake, and clutch (if equipped) pedals and clearance  
to the mat.  
• NEVER install more than one floor mat at a time in the driver’s seating position.  
• If applicable, ANY secondary set of floor mats (based upon customer preference, such as the 
all-weather floor mats or other floor mats) MUST be placed in the trunk with ALL the  
packaging material intact. Do NOT install the secondary mat on top of the primary floor mat 
already installed in the driver’s seating position.
