Failure Code RF Required Flash
CC Customer Concern
The dealer must choose which failure code to use depending on if this is a Rapid Service Update
(RSU) or Technical Service Bulletin.
● The “RF” failure code is required for essential module flash/reprogramming and can only be used after
confirmation that the VIN is included on the RSU.
● The failure code “RF” (Required Flash) can no longer be used on Technical Service Bulletin flashes. The
“RF” failure code must be used on an RSU.
● If the customer’s concern matches the SYMPTOM/CONDITION identified in the Technical Service Bulletin,
failure code CC is to be used. When utilizing this failure code, the 3C’s must be supplied.
DIAGNOSIS:
Using a Scan Tool (wiTECH) with the appropriate Diagnostic Procedures available in DealerCONNECT/
Service Library, verify all related systems are functioning as designed. If DTCs or symptom conditions, other
than the ones listed above are present, record the issues on the repair order and repair as necessary before
proceeding further with this bulletin.
If a customers VIN is listed in VIP or your RSU VIN list, perform the repair. If any vehicle not on the VIN list
exhibits any of the symptom listed above in the customer symptom section, perform the Repair Procedure.

REPAIR PROCEDURE:
WARNING!
● Before performing the software reprogramming, it is necessary to make the vehicle safe.
● When performing repairs that directly involve or imply possible contact with live high voltage
components/systems, the technician must ensure that the power supply of the high-voltage system
is disconnected throughout the operation.
● Only specifically trained technicians qualified to perform repairs on vehicles with high voltage
systems under current national laws/regulations are authorized to work on the vehicle.
● Before performing any diagnostic repair work on the vehicle, carefully read and comply with
the general instructions for working safely on hybrid/electric vehicles and use suitable general
equipment and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).
● The vehicle must not be connected to a high voltage charger when performing software updates.
NOTE: ● Install a 12 volt battery charger to ensure sufficient battery voltage which can also support
50-60 amps during the flash process.
● The remote battery posts (jump posts) under the hood may be used to connect a 12 volt
battery charger to eliminate the need to remove the battery.
● If this flash process is interrupted/aborted, the flash should be restarted.
CAUTION!
● **To lower the risk of failure modes prior to the flash update, do not open trunk, frunk or passenger
door without first opening the driver door before performing this Repair Procedure. This process
will not need to be performed after the flash update has been completed.
● Minimize on-site vehicle movements and ignition cycles where possible before performing this
Repair Procedure.**
● If the vehicle has recently been driven, on a test drive for example, the vehicle needs to sit and cool
down for one hour before performing this update. Failure to allow the vehicle to cool down may
result in substantial consequential damage to occur. Pulling the vehicle into the bay does not justify
the one hour cool down.
1. Is the vehicle on the RSU VIN list?
● YES >>> Proceed to Step 2 .
● NO >>> Proceed to Step 3 .
2. Does the BPCM, MCP A, MCP B and the EVCU have the latest software already installed?
● YES >>> This bulletin has been completed, use inspect LOP **(18-19-17-AX)** to close the active RSU.
● NO >>> Proceed to Step 3 .
3. **Remove the front storage bin. Refer to the detailed service procedures available in DealerCONNECT/
Service Library under: Service Info> 23 - Body / Exterior / Bin, Storage / Removal.
NOTE: The cooling fan must be disconnected to prevent it from powering on, which may interrupt/
abort the flash process.-3- Z08 FSAR-TSB-5027
4. Disconnect the cooling fan wire harness connector Fig. 1 **.

5. Reprogram the BPCM to the latest available software.
6. Clear DTCs.
7. Are any of the following DTCs now active or pending in the BPCM?
● P1614-00 - ECU Reset/Recovery Occurred.
● P2D3A-00 - Forced Hybrid/EV System Shutdown.
● U029A-00 - Lost Communication With Hybrid Battery Pack Sensor Module.
● YES >>> Proceed to Step 8 .
● NO >>> Proceed to Step 10 .
8. If P1614  or P2D3A  are set, use the wiTECH and navigate to the BPCM "Misc Functions" and then select
"BPCM Soft Reset". If U029A  is set, a six-minute sleep cycle will be needed to allow the code to go sleep.
After doing the sleep cycle, turn the ignition ON, reconnect the micropod, clear the DTCs and then perform
the "BPCM Soft Reset".
NOTE: ● For the six-minute sleep cycle to be successful, the micropod must be disconnected
and the ignition must be set to OFF prior to starting the sleep cycle. Additionally, all
accessories, lights and electrical units must be turned off, and hood, trunk and all doors
must be closed with no one inside the vehicle. During this sleep cycle, the vehicle may
present IPC warnings, chimes and other DTCs.
● If U00C6 or P1CDA are Active or Pending in the BPCM, no service action is required for
these DTCs and there is no impact to the customer. Proceed to Step 9 .
NOTE: ● If P0F00, P0F01, P0F02, P0F03, P0F04, P0F05, P0F06, P0F07, P0F08, P0F09, P0F0A,
P0F0B or P0F0C are present in the BPCM proceed to Step 9 .
● If a 12V reset is performed on the vehicle (12V replacement or disconnect), DTCs from
the previous two bullets may appear. If this happens, no service action is required for
these DTCs and there is no impact to the customer. Proceed to Step 9 .
9. Clear DTCs.
10. Reprogram the MCP A with the latest available software.
11. Reprogram the MCP B with the latest available software.Z08 FSAR-TSB-5027 -4-
12. Reprogram the EVCU with the latest available software.
13. Can the ignition be turned off?
● YES >>> Proceed to Step 15 .
● NO >>> Proceed to Step 14 .
14. Disconnect the 12 volt battery charger and the 12 volt battery for 15 seconds.
15. Clear DTCs.
16. Is DTC P167B-00 - Controlled System Shutdown now active in the BPCM?
● YES >>> Proceed to Step 17 .
● NO >>> Proceed to Step 19 .
17. Using wiTECH, perform a "Impact Event Fault Reset" routine. This routine is located in the ’Misc Functions’
menu for the BPCM.
18. Allow the vehicle to go to sleep. This will take approximately six minutes then proceed to Step 19 .
NOTE: For the six-minute sleep cycle to be successful, the micropod must be disconnected
and the ignition must be set to OFF prior to starting the sleep cycle. Additionally, all
accessories, lights and electrical units must be turned off, and hood, trunk and all doors
must be closed with no one inside the vehicle. During this sleep cycle, the vehicle may
present IPC warnings, chimes and other DTCs.
19. Is the vehicle equipped with Wheel End Disconnect (Sales Code DH4)?
● YES >>> Proceed to Step 20 .
● NO >>> Proceed to Step 21 .
20. Using wiTECH, perform a "Wheel End Disconnect Position Learn" routine. This routine is located in
the ’Misc Functions’ menu for the EVCU.
NOTE: If the Wheel End Disconnect Position Learn routine is not successful, roll the vehicle
slightly forward so that the wheel end disconnect actuators can align on the spline before
attempting to perform the routine again.
21. **Connect the cooling fan wire harness connector Fig. 1 .
22. Install the front storage bin. Refer to the detailed service procedures available in DealerCONNECT/
ServiceLibrary under: Service Info> 23 - Body / Exterior / Bin, Storage / Installation.**
23. Clear any DTCs that may have been set in any modules due to reprogramming. The wiTECH application
will automatically present all DTCs after the flash and allow them to be cleared.-5- Z08 FSAR-TSB-5027
