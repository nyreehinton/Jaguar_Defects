Page 2 of 6Condition
 The customer and the workshop find cracks in the rear quarter glass
 (non-moveable side windowpane). These cracks are typically found 
 toward the front of the vehicle, closer to the door. (Please see figure 1.)
Technical Background
 There are multiple causes for this condition. Generally, these causes relate to the amount of tension on the glass   
 during and after the repair. The most common causes are:
 • The quarter glass mounting nuts are over-torqued, increasing tension on the rear quarter glass.
 • The door or door glass is misaligned. This can produce a collision between the door glass and the rear   
  quarter glass or increase tension on the rear quarter glass.
 • There is adhesive leakage on the body panel slightly reducing the geometry and increasing tension.
 • There is an offset between the inner and outer body panels, changing the dimensions of the opening and   
  increasing tension.
 • The adjustable bolts are out of tolerance, which increases the tension on the glass.
 • Customer behavior may also be a factor that causes cracks. The customer may inadvertently strike the glass  
  with jewelry (including rings and watches) or allow his or her bodyweight to rest on the glass pane while   
  exiting the vehicle.

Service Information
 Please replace the affected glass pane(s) as instructed in WM 647519 – Removing and installing side window   
 (Coupe).
 Repair tips:
 1. Generally, the goal is not to put the rear quarter glass pane under more tension than necessary for the repair. 
 2. Exercise caution when tightening the fastening nuts for the glass pane.  Applying too much torque to the   
  fastening nuts may cause the glass pane to crack.
 3. Note that the door position also affects tension at the rear quarter glass. Please check the position of the   
  door relative to the side  panel  (in yellow, on figure 2). The door may need to be adjusted outward slightly.

  adhesive is blue on figure 3.)
 5. There should be no offset, or gap, between the inner and outer layers of the side body panel. (See figure 4.)

  to the bolt rotating. (See figure 5 for values.)
 7. Adjust the side window outward using the window regulator adjusting bolt. (Note the values and illustration   
  in figure 6.)
 8. Remind to customer to be careful not to strike the glass with jewelry and to exit the vehicle without    
  allowing his or her weight to rest on the glass.
