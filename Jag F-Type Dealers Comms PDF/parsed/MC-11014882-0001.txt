2GENERAL SAFETY GUIDELINES
WARNING! PLEASE READ AND FOLLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS
TO AVOID PERSONAL INJURY OR DEATH:
When working on or around a vehicle, the following guidelines should be observed AT ALL TIMES :
 ▲ Park the vehicle on a level surface, apply the 
parking brakes, and always block the wheels.  
Always wear personal protection equipment.  
 ▲Stop the engine and remove the ignition key 
when working under or around the vehicle.  
When working in the engine compartment, 
the  engine  should  be  shut  off   and  the  ignition 
key should be removed. Where circumstances 
require that the engine be in operation, EXTREME 
CAUTION  should be used to prevent personal 
injury resulting from contact with moving, 
rotating, leaking, heated, or electrically charged 
components.
 ▲Do not attempt to install, remove, disassemble, 
or assemble a component until you have read, 
and thoroughly understand, the recommended 
procedures. Use only the proper tools and 
observe all precautions pertaining to use of those 
tools.
 ▲If the work is being performed on the vehicle’s 
air brake system, or any auxiliary pressurized air 
systems, make certain to drain the air pressure 
from all reservoirs before beginning ANY  work 
on the vehicle.  If the vehicle is equipped with 
a Bendix® AD-IS® air dryer system, a Bendix® 
DRM™ dryer reservoir module, a Bendix® AD-9si®, 
AD-HF®, or AD-HFi® air dryer, be sure to drain the 
purge reservoir.
 ▲Following the vehicle manufacturer’s 
recommended procedures, deactivate the 
electrical system in a manner that safely removes 
all electrical power from the vehicle.
 ▲Never exceed manufacturer’s recommended 
pressures.   ▲Never connect or disconnect a hose or line 
containing pressure; it may whip and/or cause 
hazardous airborne dust and dirt particles. Wear 
eye protection. Slowly open connections with 
care, and verify that no pressure is present. Never 
remove a component or plug unless you are 
certain all system pressure has been depleted.
 ▲ Use only genuine Bendix® brand replacement 
parts, components, and kits. Replacement 
hardware, tubing, hose, fittings, wiring, etc. 
must be of equivalent size, type, and strength as 
original equipment and be designed specifi  cally 
for such applications and systems.
 ▲Components with stripped threads or damaged 
parts should be replaced rather than repaired.  
Do not attempt repairs requiring machining or 
welding unless specifi  cally stated and approved 
by the vehicle and component manufacturer.
 ▲Prior to returning the vehicle to service, make 
certain all components and systems are restored 
to their proper operating condition.
 ▲ For vehicles with Automatic Traction Control 
(ATC), the ATC function must be disabled (ATC 
indicator lamp should be ON) prior to performing 
any vehicle maintenance where one or more 
wheels on a drive axle are lifted off   the ground 
and moving.
 ▲The power MUST be temporarily disconnected 
from the radar sensor whenever any tests USING 
A DYNAMOMETER are conducted on a vehicle 
equipped with a Bendix® Wingman® system.
 ▲ You should consult the vehicle manufacturer's operating and service manuals, and any related literature, 
in conjunction with the Guidelines above.
 
Improper use and/or maintenance of the Bendix® Fusion™ Active Safety System can result in a collision causing 
property damage, serious injuries, or death. Be sure to read, understand, and carefully follow the instructions 
in the Operator’s Manual, BW2681.
 
Due to the inherent limitations of image recognition technology, camera-based safety technology — on rare 
occasions — may not be able to detect or may misinterpret lane markings. At these times, alerts may not 
occur, or erroneous alerts may occur.
 IMPORT ANT
It is the responsibility of the driver to remain vigilant and change driving practices depending on traffic and 
road conditions.1.1

42.0 TROUBLESHOOTING
2.1 SAFETY GUIDELINES
Read and follow the General Safety Guidelines shown in 
this document.
 IMPORT ANT
All vehicle Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTCs) related 
to the engine, transmission, instrument cluster, 
engine cruise control, and Bendix® Antilock Braking 
System (ABS), Automatic Traction Control (ATC), or 
Electronic Stability Program (ESP®) systems must first 
be resolved, with no DTCs present during the vehicle 
operation while in cruise control, before trying to 
resolve camera DTCs.
 IMPORT ANT
If a problem with the Bendix FLC-20 camera is detected, 
it should be serviced as soon as possible to restore 
full functionality.
2.2  BENDIX™ DRIVER INTERFACE 
UNIT (DIU™) LANE DEPARTURE 
WARNING SYSTEM ICONS
See Figure 3 and Figure 4.  In the case of vehicles that use 
a Bendix™ Driver Interface Unit (DIU™), the top right corner 
of the display is used to show an icon. For other Original 
Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) displays, see the vehicle 
manual to find the method used to show the system status.During Start-Up – System Busy
The first symbol shows when the LDW 
system is initializing.
Camera Impaired
If the system experiences 
problems detecting objects 
(for example, due to severe 
weather conditions, a dirty 
windshield, obstructions, etc.), 
a full DIU screen message will 
briefly be displayed.
The screen will revert to displaying 
the icon shown, until the problem is 
resolved.
Normal Operation
The LDW system is actively seeking 
lane-markings.
The LDW system is actively tracking 
lane-markings on both sides of the 
current lane.
The system is actively tracking only 
lane-markings on the left.
The system is actively tracking only 
lane-markings on the right.
Figure 3 – Normal Bendix DIU Screens Showing 
LDW  System Status
Diagnostic Trouble Code (DTC) Set
If no LDW status is shown – and the 
driver has not applied the LDW disable 
switch – this indicates that the system 
has detected a DTC.
Figure 4 – Bendix DIU Screen Showing 
LDW System Status
In these cases, the OE vehicle dash display will also alert 
the operator that there is a DTC present.
52.3  TEMPORARILY DISABLE THE LANE 
DEPARTURE WARNING (LDW)
To avoid erroneous LDW warnings in areas such as 
construction zones – where the non-standard or overlapping 
road markings present might cause false alerts – the 
Bendix® Fusion™ Active Safety System has an enable/
disable switch. The Bendix switch design or a similar OEM 
switch may be used. See Figure 5 .
Figure 5 – Example of an LDW 
Enable/Disable Switch
For vehicles that have the LDW switch hard-wired to the 
SafetyDirect® by Rand McNally® Web Portal Processor, 
and a functioning On Board Computer (OBC)/Telematics 
system: The enable/disable switch used by the LDW 
system also functions – when depressed for six (6) seconds 
– to activate a manual request to transmit the last five 
seconds and next five seconds of buffered video data.
2.4  SETTING DIAGNOSTIC 
TROUBLE CODES (DTC s)
If, during operation, the Bendix Fusion system detects a 
problem with the FLC-20 camera, a DTC will be set and 
– depending on the OEM – the driver will be alerted on 
the dash display with an icon or similar method. In these 
cases, some or all features of the Fusion system or LDW 
system will not be available. 
If the system experiences problems detecting objects 
(for example, due to severe weather conditions, a dirty 
windshield, obstructions, etc.), a DTC will typically be set. 2.5  BENDIX® ACOM® DIAGNOSTIC

MThis DTC is not an indicator of a malfunctioning camera. Do not  replace the camera.
Possible Causes:
• The camera is missing the J1939 messages it is expecting from one or more sources. This could 
be accompanied by other active DTCs from the same source.
Review Section 2.10 Serial Data (J1939) Troubleshooting Procedure.
Perform the following:
• Check the expected source(s) of the signal to identify why the messages are not being transmitted. 
A communication link may be disconnected, the power fuse disconnected or blown, or a change 
was made to the controller supplying the message that was incorrect.
• Confirm there were no software updates on suspect sources that could have impacted the 
broadcast of the missing message.
• Once the source of the missing information has been corrected, clear the camera’s DTCs .
NOTE: The system will not report newly active J1939 DTCs until the engine has been running for 15 seconds. 
Do not attempt to diagnose J1939 DTCs without the engine running.

NThis DTC is not an indicator of a malfunctioning camera. Do not  replace the camera.
Possible causes:
• The system using the camera has found J1939 signal(s) it is expecting, but the values are invalid 
or erroneous, indicating that there is a malfunctioning component and/or wiring error.
• Some examples of components, cameras, or switches that produce J1939 signals are: brake 
pressure switches; steering angle sensors; lighting indicators (high/low beam lights, turn signals); 
windshield wiper status; various engine torque signals; Bendix Fusion Active Safety System 
components; and wheel speed sensors.
Perform the following:
• Check the Bendix Fusion components or the ABS for DTCs. 
• Check the engine and cab/body controllers for active DTCs using the manufacturer’s diagnostic 
procedures. NOTE: If the controller that broadcasts the signal or wiring is faulty, these issues must 
be addressed prior to attempting to clear the camera DTCs. 
After addressing the possible causes, perform the following: 
• Clear the camera’s DTCs .
QThis DTC is not an indicator of a malfunctioning camera. Do not  replace the camera.
Possible Causes:
• The camera is indicating that it is either not calibrated or an error has occurred. Camera calibration 
is learned at the ignition cycle of the vehicle. This calibration is stored in the ABS controller and is 
a message broadcast at system start-up.
• Camera mounting is improper and the camera on-road alignment learned an out-of-range value.
• The ABS controller may be disconnected or configuration from the ABS controller may be sending 
invalid information.
Perform the following:
• Remove battery power to the vehicle to confirm that power is being removed.
• Cycle the ignition power. Confirm all system components are turning off (there should be no 
ignition voltage with the key in the off position). Turn the key back on. Repeat the key cycle up to 
15 times, giving adequate time for all components to fully shut down between cycles. 
• Verify proper mounting per section 3.0. Measure and see if the camera was mounted properly 
on the windshield. If an improper mounting arrangement is discovered, follow the instructions 
included in this document to remove the camera. The adhesive cannot be re-used. Order the 
approved bracket with adhesive per the OE build sheet to install and re-mount the camera onto the 
windshield. 
 NOTE:  If both the camera and ABS controller are being replaced at the same time, a Single 
Pole Target Auto-Calibration (SPTAC) will be required to configure the camera (SPTAC target 
part number K159472). It is not necessary to perform an SPTAC when a camera is replaced 
and the ABS controller has not been replaced. 
• Clear the camera’s DTCs .
NOTE: The system will not report newly active J1939 DTCs until the engine has been running for 15 seconds. 
Do not attempt to diagnose J1939 DTCs without the engine running.

142.9  TROUBLESHOOTING DIAGNOSTIC 
TROUBLE CODES: POWER SUPPLY
All wire harness connectors must be properly seated to 
maintain electrical connectivity. Push the mating connectors 
until they click. When replacing a Bendix Fusion FLC-20 
camera, check that the wire harness connectors are free 
of damage, including corrosion, before plugging into a new 
camera. Check for corroded or damaged wiring connector 
problems such as opens or shorts to voltage or ground.
If the connector terminals are corroded, this may be 
an indication of water intrusion into the wiring system 
and possibly into the camera (presumably from a 
cracked windshield). Replacement of the entire harness 
is recommended. If the terminals of the camera are 
corroded, replacement of the camera is recommended.

TROUBLESHOOTING PROCEDURE
The Bendix™ FLC-20™ camera requires private network 
messages to and from the Bendix Fusion system. The 
camera will set a DTC if these messages are not present, 
or if there is a problem with the private communications 
system. Refer to SD-61-4963, Bendix® Fusion™ FLR-21™ 
Radar Sensor, on B2Bendix.com for full troubleshooting 
information.
NOTE:  Confirm there are no DTCs on other components. 
If there are active DTCs, they should be addressed prior to 
performing additional troubleshooting procedures. 
1. Take all measurements at the harness connector unless 
otherwise indicated.
 
Do not insert any probe into the pin on the mating 
connector of the sensor that is greater than the width 
of a terminal. Damaged connector pins will require the 
replacement of the harness.
2.  Check for damaged or reversed Private Communications 
wiring.
  If the Private Communications HIGH, or Private 
Communications LOW, wiring circuits are damaged, 
such as shorting together, the entire Private 
Communications link will be lost. The problem may be 
intermittent, enabling the Private Communications link 
to operate normally sometimes. In this event, multiple 
diagnostic trouble codes may be logged in the camera 
and radar.
  If the Private Communications HIGH, and Private 
Communications LOW, wiring circuits are reversed, 
communication over the entire Private Communications 
link will be lost. Devices that use the affected network 
will not be able to transmit or receive messages on that 
network.
3.  Check for corroded or damaged wiring connector 
problems such as opens or shorts to voltage or ground.
4.  If the connector terminals are corroded, this may be 
an indication of water intrusion into the wiring system 
and possibly the camera sensor. Replacement of the 
entire harness is recommended. If the terminals of the 
camera sensor are corroded, replacement of the sensor 
is recommended.5.  Check for other Private Communications devices 
which may be inhibiting communication. The service 
technician should consult the procedures for Private 
Communications troubleshooting. The device’s power 
should be removed and measurements made at the 
FLC-20 pins for shorts to ground and power pins and 
resistance between the Private Communications HIGH 
or Private Communications LOW input circuits.
6.  Unplug the camera harness. With the ignition switch 
off, measure the resistance (ohms) using a multimeter 
between harness pins 6 and 7. The reading should be 
approximately 120 ohms. If it is not, the vehicle wiring 
should be investigated.
2.11  POWER TROUBLESHOOTING 
PROCEDURES
1.  Unplug the camera. With the ignition switch ON, using 
a multimeter, measure the voltage between harness 
pin 9 and ground. The measurement should indicate 
10 to 16 VDC (Volts DC). If this is not the case, the 
vehicle wiring should be investigated using procedures 
described by the manufacturer.
2.  Unplug the camera. With the camera ignition switch 
OFF, using a multimeter, measure the voltage between 
harness pin 9 and ground. The measurement should 
indicate zero VDC . If this is not the case, the vehicle 
wiring should be investigated using procedures 
described by the manufacturer.
3.  Unplug the camera. With the ignition switch OFF, using 
a multimeter, measure the voltage between harness 
pin 1 and ground. The measurement should indicate 
10 to 16 VDC. If this is not the case, the vehicle wiring 
should be investigated using procedures described by 
the manufacturer.
  If the connector terminals are corroded or damaged, this 
may be an indication of water intrusion into the wiring 
system and possibly into the sensor. Replacement of 
the entire harness is recommended. If the terminals of 
the sensor are corroded, replacement of the sensor is 
recommended.
4.  Check for other J1939 devices which may be inhibiting 
J1939 communication. The service technician should 
consult the vehicle manufacturer’s procedures for 
other J1939 troubleshooting procedures. The device’s 
power should be removed and measurements made at 
the ECU pins for shorts to ground and power pins and 
resistance between the J1939 HIGH or J1939 LOW 
input circuits.
5.  Unplug the camera harness. With the camera ignition 
OFF, measure the resistance (ohms) using a multimeter 
between harness pins 3 and 4. The reading should 
be approximately 60 ohms. If this is not the case, the 
vehicle wiring should be investigated.

pins will require the replacement of the harness.
2. Check for damaged or reversed J1939 wiring.
  If the J1939 HIGH, or J1939 LOW, wiring circuits are 
damaged, such as shorting together, the entire J1939 
link will be lost. The problem may be intermittent, 
enabling the J1939 link to operate normally sometimes. 
If this occurs, multiple diagnostic trouble codes will 
be logged in multiple engine and vehicle controllers.  
 
If the J1939 HIGH, and J1939 LOW, wiring circuits are 
reversed, communication over the entire J1939 link will 
be lost. Devices that use the affected network will not be 
able to transmit or receive messages on that network.

Whenever re-installing or replacing a camera – 
for example, after a windshield is replaced – the 
recommended position for the vehicle must be used. 
Failure to install the camera in the correct position can 
result in system Diagnostic Trouble Codes being set, 
system performance degradation, and/or a collision 
causing property damage, serious injuries, or death .
The ambient temperature must be in the range of 50-100º F 
(10-38º C). Thoroughly clean the area of the windshield 
where the camera will be installed with a lint-free cloth and 
a 50-50 water/isopropyl alcohol solution. Make certain that there is no grease or contamination 
present and that the windshield is completely dry before 
installing the bracket. 
Use removable tape or a non-permanent marker to indicate 
where the top of the bracket will be installed. Remove the 
protective film from the tape covering the adhesive on the 
bracket and, using a small “torpedo” level to be sure that 
it is level, install the bracket on the glass, holding firmly [a 
minimum of 62 lb. (28.1 kg.) pressure] in place for ten (10) 
seconds. Wait at least 20 minutes before installing 
the camera,  at which point a 50% bond strength is 
created.  The full bond between the bracket and windshield 
is achieved after 72 hours.

the slots, fully seating them. 
2.  Then – gently prying by moving the screwdriver 
handles away from the windshield a small amount 
– push against the retaining clips to release the camera. 
213.2 BRACKET REMOVAL
The camera must be removed prior to this procedure. The 
preferred method for removing a bracket ideally requires 
two technicians. Using a heat-gun, one of the technicians 
gradually applies heat to the outside of the windshield at 
the location of the adhesive, while the other gently applies 
a prying force to the bracket while being careful not to 
damage the windshield. 
As soon as the ideal temperature is reached, the bracket 
will release. Allow the windshield to completely cool down 
before cleaning the glass and installing a replacement 
bracket.
When replacing brackets, use only replacements with the 
same part number or a direct superceding replacement 
number supplied by the OEM. 
NOTE:  Some OEMs may offer the windshield with 
the bracket pre-installed. Contact the dealer for more 
information. 
3.3 DASH SWITCHES AND LAMPS
Each OEM has their own method for displaying the system 
status to the driver, and typically there will be a switch on 
the dash board to allow the driver to temporarily disable the 
system. Refer to the OEM Operator’s Manual for system 
indicator lamp(s) used for the FLC-20 camera, and whether 
there is a bulb-check illumination at vehicle power-up. See 
Figure 12 for some examples of OEM icons used at the 
time this document was published.

Additionally, the system self-monitors and will set a 
Diagnostic Trouble Code (DTC) that will typically alert 
the driver using a similar icon on the dash display or by 
a status lamp. See Section 2.0,Troubleshooting, for more 
information.3.4 MAINTENANCE
In normal use, the Bendix FLC-20 camera needs proper 
mounting and a clean, properly maintained windshield to 
ensure a clear view of the road ahead . Protect the camera 
lens whenever the inside of the windshield is cleaned. You 
may check that the camera’s view is clear by taking a test 
image.
3.5 CAMERA INTERCHANGEABILITY
When replacing cameras only, use replacements with the 
same part number (or a direct superceding replacement 
number supplied by Bendix). After replacing the camera, 
run the engine for two (2) minutes and verify no faults 
are present. Once confirmed no faults are shown with 
the engine running, drive the vehicle for 5 – 20 miles  
(8 – 32 km) or until a speed sign is displayed by the system. 
 
Cameras of different vehicle models and model years 
must not be interchanged. The use of an incorrect 
camera can lead to Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTCs) 
being set, and performance degradation – including 
unnecessary system interventions and the potential 
for situations where interventions do not occur when 
they would normally.
Cameras are designed specifically for a particular vehicle 
and model. DTCs caused by relocating cameras to an 
incorrect vehicle may result in the vehicle system using 
the camera to be partially or fully unavailable.
If you have questions, contact the Bendix Tech Team at 
1-800-AIR-BRAKE (1-800-247-2725), option 2.

state-of-the-art-vision algorithms.
