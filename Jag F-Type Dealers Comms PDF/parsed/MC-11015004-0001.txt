DESCRIPTION
The Mazda DCA-8000 is required for all warranty battery testing. If the Mazda DCA-8000 is not used, incorrect battery 
testing may result in unnecessary battery replacement. Use the following test procedures in this Service Bulletin to test 
Mazda vehicle batteries and to generate a Warranty Code.
NOTE: A Warranty Code is required for warranty claim submission
Battery Identification (Mazda batteries have 2 rating types)
1. JIS (Japanese Industrial Standard):
JIS codes are six-digit alpha-numeric markings molded into the top of the battery to identify a battery by the capacity 
(amps), dimensions, and battery terminal type. Vehicles manufactured in Japan come from the factory with a JIS rated 
battery.
NOTE: Replacement batteries may use a CCA rating. If so, use the CCA rating listed on the battery.

2. CCA (Cold Cranking Amps):
CCA ratings are normally located on a sticker affixed to the top of the battery to indicate a battery’s Cold Cranking Amps. 
CCA rated batteries are supplied with domestically produced vehicles.
NOTE: If an incorrect CCA rating is entered into the Mazda DCA-8000, it will result in a false result and invalid Warranty 
Code from the tester. This will also result in unnecessary replacement of batteries.
TEST PROCEDURE
Mazda DCA-8000 Main Menu
1. Connect the charger clamps to the appropriate battery posts.  
NOTE: For CX-90/ CX-70  Clamp Attachment, use duct tape (A) or equivalent to hold the cable as shown.
2. At the Main Menu, select In Vehicle Charge and the Acquire VIN screen is displayed.

3. Scan the barcode located on the driver’s side door frame using the provided wireless barcode scanner. A single beep 
indicates the scan was successful.  
NOTE:
If the DCA-8000 isn't used very often, the scanner might go dead because it only charges when the unit is 
plugged in and on. •
If your barcode scanner is unavailable for some reason, the VIN can also be entered manually.•
If the battery parameters were not filled in from the VIN scan, manually enter the battery information.•
Select the correct rating system for the battery by identifying the correct JIS code (A) stamped onto the batter top 
or CCA code (B) printed on the battery label. The battery hold down may need to be removed in order to read the 
JIS code.•
  
For MX-30, the battery does not follow Japanese Industrial Standard, therefore input CCA of 295A.•
For CX-90/ CX-70 H3T (inline 6) M Hybrid Boost, use the following information for DCA-8000 test/charging since 
the battery label is not visible without removing the battery.
JIS (Japanese Industrial Standard) - 75D23L○
CCA (Cold Cranking Amps) - 465A○•
For CX-90/ CX-70  PHEV (2.5L), the battery label is not visible, but the battery type is Q85. Use the following 
temporary Q85 Battery Charging Procedure until DCA-8000 software update is available.•
a. Change Cranking Units to CCA.
b. Edit Battery Info, then Select Continue.

4. Complete the battery test by following the on-screen instructions and entering the appropriate information. Refer to the 
Mazda DCA-8000 Quick Start Guide or Midtronics online Instruction Manual  for more information.
 
5. After the test, the DCA-8000 will display one of the possible battery test results listed below. Review the results and 
follow the Action for the displayed result.
Battery Tester Display Action
“GOOD BATTERY” Return the battery to service.
“GOOD - RECHARGE” Fully charge the battery and return it to service.
“CHARGE AND RETEST” Fully charge the battery and retest. Failure to fully charge th
e battery before retesting may cause false readings. If CHA
RGE AND RETEST appears again after you fully charge th
e battery, replace the battery.
“REPLACE BATTERY” A REPLACE BATTERY result may also mean a poor conne
ction between the battery and the vehicle. If you tested the 
battery using the System test, disconnect the battery cables 
and retest using the Battery Test before replacing it.
6. Select Send Results then select Print to get a test result print out.

NOTE: This will autocmatically transfer the 17-digit VIN.  
5. For I-STOP batteries, enter the battery type as i-ELOOP.  
 
 
 
NOTE: Select the correct rating system for the battery by identifying the correct JIS code (A) stamped onto the batter top 
or CCA code (B)
 
6. Run battery test by following the on-screen instructions, visit the Midtronics online Instruction Manual for more 
information.  
7. Select Send Results then select Print to get a test result print out. 1. Write the Warranty Code on the RO and attach 
the printed results to the RO (do not attach with tape due to reaction with the printer paper).
