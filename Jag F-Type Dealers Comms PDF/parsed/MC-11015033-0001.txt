Symptom/Vehicle Issue : Replacement Exterior Mirror Glass Connector Does Not 
Match For Blind S pot. 
 
 
Discussion : During 2024 production there was an engineering change on exterior 
mirrors . The glass blind spot indicator changed . The “early  mirror glass ” design  with 
the early  blind spot is no longer available in MOPAR , however there is a “new mirror  
glass ” design  with the new blind spot monitor indicator for all the model years for 
production and service.  This “new mirror glass ” has a different connector for the blind 
spot indicator.  An adapting jumper harness has been created to allow inst allation of 
the new mirror glass to the early  mirror wiring with the new blind spot glass.  
 
Part Information : Jumper Part number: 68673054AA .
