Correction:  
Please follow the SI diagnostics for "K eyless Entry System Malfunction", which includes
checking the exterior door handle switches to verify the parameters change in the scan
tool.
If the parameter is not changing for a certain exterior door handle switch it could be
caused by several things such as the door handle switch, wiring/connections between the
door handle switch and module, etc.  
Additionally , there has been cases where aftermark et exterior door handle covers have
been installed and they have been known to interfere with the proper operation of the
door handle switch.  
In these cases, the aftermark et covers should be removed.
