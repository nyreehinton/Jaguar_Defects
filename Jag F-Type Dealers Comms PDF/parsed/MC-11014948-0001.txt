ServiceService
When replacing Evaporative Emissions System components, it is not always necessary to replace the entire EVAP canister system as a complete
assembly, if the failed components are available as standalone replacement parts.
If technical diagnosis has determined that only a single component has failed (e.g. the EVAP canister or the Leak Detection Pump ), check
whether this part may be replaced separately. In the example Figure 1 shown below, the canister can be replaced separately, and the original
Leak Detection Pump and air filter assembly may be re-used with the new replacement canister. The opposite also applies, where the Leak
Detection Pump could be exchanged while re-using the original EVAP canister.
Figure 1.  Example: ETKA indicates that the EVAP Canister is available as a separate component within the complete assembly.
If it has been determined through technical diagnosis that the entire assembly must be replaced, or if the parts are not separately available per
current ETKA information, then this bulletin does not apply.
