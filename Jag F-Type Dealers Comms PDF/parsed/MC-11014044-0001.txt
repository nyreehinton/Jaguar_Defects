Note: Please refer to SI document 2610129. The following information only applies to
transmissions with a source code (item number 7 in document 2610129) of (2).

Condition / Concern
Customers ma y comment on a dela yed engagement into drive, shudder at a launch, or
the transmission is slipping when shifting into 1st, 2nd, 3rd or 4th gears.
The customer ma y also comment that they feel a bump or hear a clunk noise during a 1-2
shift.
These concerns ma y only be present when the transmission is at operating temperature.
Recommendations / Instructions
These concerns ma y be due to loose stator support to pump cover bolts causing a leak at
the stator support to pump cover gask et. 
If the root cause cannot be found following normal SI diagnostics, remove the transmission
ﬂuid pan and the transmission control assemblies.  
Referring to the picture below and wearing proper eye protection apply compressed air to
the 1-2-3-4 clutch apply passage and inspect for air leaking out of the compensator feed
passage in the pump cover . 
If no leakage is found out of the compensator feed passage listen for excessive air leakage
inside the transmission.  
Callout 1  
Component Name: Applying compressed air to the 1234 clutch passage.  
Callout 2  
Component Name: Compensator feed passage.  
You ma y also notice ﬂuid leaking or see a misaligned gask et by looking up through the
case opening between the pump stator support and the 1234/35R clutch housing during
this test as shown below . 
Callout 2  
Component Name: Gap between the pump cover and the 1234/35R clutch housing.  
If excessive air leakage is found inspect the transmission ﬂuid pump for loose stator
support to pump cover bolts or a misaligned stator support to pump cover gask et.  
Note: The bolts should never be check ed for being loose by using a hand tool. The bolts
are supposed to be torqued at the factory and never loosened. The recommended
procedure to check for loose bolts is to use your ﬁngers or just a sock et and your ﬁngers
and attempt to rotate the bolts in a counter clockwise direction. If the bolts are loose for
any reason the pump cover must be replaced.  
Refer to the picture below . 
Callout 1  
Component Name: Misaligned Gask et 
Callout 2  
Component Name: Stator Support Bolts  
If any of the bolts are loose or the gask et is misaligned or leaking, the transmission pump
cover must be replaced and the 1234 clutch plates should be inspected for  being
distressed and repaired as needed.  
Note: The transmission adapts must be reset if the pump cover is replaced to address this
concern.  
This PI will update to a bulletin in the futur e
