Important W arning for W orking on the High-V oltage (HV) systems on BMW Group vehicles:
 
Only properly trained personnel, who passed all applicable HV T echnical T raining Courses, should
perform repairs which require disconnecting, or removal of High V oltage battery components on any
Hybrid or Electric V ehicle. W ork performed on High V oltage systems by unqualified persons may
result in severe injury or damage to the vehicle. Additional safety information is found in Repair
Instruction 61 00… “Observe safety instructions when handling electric vehicles”.
 
Prior to disconnecting, or the removal of any HV component, the HV system needs to be disabled
and secured (by means of the HV Service Disconnect Switch and lock out) by a properly trained HV
technician, who has a minimum HV Qualification level after completing the T echnical T raining
Course “ST2324 High V oltage Drivetrain Systems” which as of 1/2023* includes ST1824 Alternative
Drive Part 1.

* Note: As of January 2023, the HV component portion of the “ST2205 Generation 5 High-voltage
class” ( except for the High V oltage Battery) has been merged into “ST2324 High V oltage Drivetrain
Systems”.
Up to Generation 4 V ehicles once vehicle’ s HV system is disabled (the “Blitz” - lightning bolt icon is
displayed in instrument cluster , see below), a technician without HV Certification may remove a HV
component (e.g., EH Heater , EKK Compressor , EME Control Unit, et.), except for the High V oltage
Battery .
 
For Generation 5 V ehicles however , the specific vehicle training is required to diagnose, remove and
service any HV component and it is NOT allowed for non HV certified technicians to work on the
high voltage system.  
 
 
High V oltage Battery removal and rework can ONLY be performed by a High-voltage Certified
Technician with a HV Battery Certification level corresponding to a specific Electric or Hybrid
vehicle, for example:
 
To repair GEN4 HV battery of G05 PHEV a certification from T echnical T raining Course “ST2006 –
SP44 HV Battery” or equivalent ST1825 – Alternative Drive Part 2 is required (or as of 1/2023 the
equivalent “ST 2325 for High V oltage Battery Systems”).
And
To repair A GEN5 HV battery the T echnical T raining Course “ST2205 Generation 5 High-voltage
class” is required or as of 1/2023* the equivalent “ST 2325 for High V oltage Battery Systems”.
 
*Note: As of January 2023, the “ST2205 Generation 5 High-voltage stand-alone class” has been
merged into “ST2324 for High V oltage Drivetrain Systems” and “ST2325 for High V oltage Battery
Systems.”
