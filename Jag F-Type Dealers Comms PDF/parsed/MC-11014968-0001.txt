DIAGNOSTIC STEP(s)
 
Issue #1: Hood Noises – Squeaking or Rattling
Drive the truck over various road conditions to determine if the hood makes squeaking or rattling noises. The noises generally occur
when the truck is rocking over uneven surfaces at speeds generally over 5-10 MPH.
Issue #2: Hood Knocking and Bouncing
Drive the truck over various road conditions to determine if the hood knocks or bounces. The bounce condition can be seen at the top
of the hood where it meets the base of the windshield and generally occurs when the truck is moving at speeds of 45 MPH or higher .
When the hood starts to bounce it will normally create a knocking noise when it bounces against the hood stops.
IMPORT ANT NOTE:  Before completing any of the diagnostic steps below , verify that the hood is properly mounted and aligned per
iKNow Article IK1600247 - Hood Gap and Alignment Tolerances. Also verify the hood stops and hood latch hardware are properly
secured and that these parts are not loose, bent, or damaged. If so, replace the damaged/defective parts before proceeding.

REPAIR STEP(s)
 
 
Figur e 3: Newly added Gr ease to Hood Stops and Hood Guides
 
The standard repair for the hood bouncing and or knocking is to rivet a hand-fabricated rubber spacer onto both hood guides to fill
the space between the hood stop and the end of the hood guide when the hood is closed. (See Figure #4) Use a high-quality piece of
rubber such as a slice of f of a mud flap. The thickness should be approximately 1/4" to 3/16” thick and approximately 1.0” X 2.5” in
size. (See Figure #5 Left side is shown, the right side is the opposite)
