Ultium PowerUP Level 2 Chargers are Electric Vehicle drive motor battery chargers designed to be installed in a
customer’s home. The chargers are covered under the terms of a 3-year Limited Parts Warranty from the date of
purchase. The limited warranty is only valid for the original purchaser and is not transferrable.
This Warranty does NOT cover:
• Damage or failure due to negligence, alteration, accident, abuse, improper installation (including software
updates), operation or storage, faulty wiring or connections, or use for a purpose which the product is not
designed or approved by GM
• Normal wear & tear
• Loss of time, inconvenience, loss of use of the vehicle, or other consequential damages
• Labor cost for electrical diagnosis, removal or installation
• Products utilized for vehicles registered and normally operated outside of the United States or Canada
Note For Canada Customers:  The customer should first contact the EV Concierge team at 1 (833) 382-4389 for
warranty information prior to removal of the charger. If a replacement charger is required, the EV Concierge team will
contact the Dealer to advise of the charger replacement.
 
Dealers are to conduct an inspection of the charger for signs of abuse or damage. (Damage or abuse would not be
considered as a warrantable replacement).
Dealers are to verify warranty eligibility by requesting from the customer their original receipt or proof of purchase
which must specify the original purchase of part number 84922762 or 85642869. A copy is to be retained by the
dealer in order to support the parts replacement transaction.
Dealers should provide the consumer with a replacement charger of the same model/part number and submit an
over-the-counter warranty claim (ZPTC Transaction Type) for reimbursement. Subsequent replacements under the
warranty will receive the balance of the original warranty period but not less than 12 months.
Chargers replaced under warranty should be retained in accordance with currently published warranty parts handling
procedures and retention policies.
GM will be requesting initial failed chargers be returned to the Warranty Parts Center for root cause analysis.
Dealers will receive a return request upon claim payment. Refer to the latest version of Service Bulletin

GM bulletins are intended for use by professional technicians, NOT a "do-it-yourselfer" . They are written to inform these
technicians of conditions that may occur on some vehicles, or to provide information that could assist in the proper
service of a vehicle. Properly trained technicians have the equipment, tools, safety instructions, and know-how to do a job
properly and safely. If a condition is described, DO NOT assume that the bulletin applies to your vehicle, or that your
vehicle will have that condition. See your GM dealer for information on whether your vehicle may beneﬁt from the
information.
