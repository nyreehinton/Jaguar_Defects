Circular Letter  
FROM : Maserati TSO      
TO: Maserati Network   
 
 
DATE : FEBRUARY 3  2025 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
As recently communicated in Rapid Update #658 669 684 712 regarding the need to replace 
the front shock absorbers on the new GranTurismo vehicles , we would like to remind you that, 
starting from last July 2024, the components available from our network are identified, for 
internal supplier reasons, with two different series of part numbers . 
 
However, we would like to point out that the components are the same , therefore both codes 
can be used interchangeably.  
It is also specified that the HQ Supply Chain reserves the right to send one pair or another of 
components indiscriminately depending on availability.  
Below are all correct part numbers, as of the date of this bulletin, which will be admitted in the 
warranty claims.  
 
It is understood that any part numbers introduced in the future will be considered compliant and 
suitable for the execution of the campaign.
