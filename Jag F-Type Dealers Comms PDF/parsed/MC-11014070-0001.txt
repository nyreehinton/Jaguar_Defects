INTRODUCTION 
 
Nissan is conducting this voluntar
y emission s recall campaign on certain specific model 
year 2017 Titan XD vehicles equipped with a diesel engine, to replace the Engine Control Module (ECM). This service will be performed at  no charge to the customer for parts or 
labor.   
IDENTIFICATION NUMBER 
 
Nissan has assigned identificat ion number PD126 to this ca mpaign. This number must 
appear on all communication and documentation of any nature dealing with this campaign 
. 
  
DEALER RESPONSIBILITY 
 
It is the dealer’s responsib
ility to check Serv ice COMM or Dealer Business Systems (DBS) 
National Service History for the campaign stat us on each vehicle falling within the range of 
this voluntary emissions recall which for any reason enters the service department. This 
includes vehicles purchased from private parties  or presented by transient (tourist) owners 
and vehicles in a dealer’s inventory.  Federal law requires that new vehicles in dealer 
inventory which are the subject of a safety recall must be corrected prior to sale.  
Failure to do so can result in civil penalties by the Na tional Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration .  While federal law applies only to new vehicles, Nissan strongly 
encourages dealers to correct any used vehicles in  their inventory before they are retailed.
