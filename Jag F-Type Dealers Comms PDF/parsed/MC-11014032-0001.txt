 As a product improvement, Pierce is now offering an exclusive Hosemate
TM Safety Swivel . These flanges will be 
bolt-on and retrofitted to any Akron/Elkhart four -bolt flanged valves using the same bolts and gaskets found on the 
standard swivel and plug. We also offer the Trident Hosemate in the flange sizes for the F1, F3, and F5 lengths. 
This new safety swivel allows the end user to avoid twists in hose lines as they are charged.
