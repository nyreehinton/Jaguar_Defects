This CBR solution addresses crank no start and engine dying issues in some VN(4) models
caused by an incorrect fuel line configuration.
 
 
1.0 Overview
 
This CBR solution addresses crank no start and engine dying issues
caused by an incorrect fuel line configuration in some VN(4) models. In
these instances, the truck may run out of fuel and lose prime while the fuel
level gauge still displays 1/4 tank of fuel available.
 
This issue arises when the right-hand fuel tank supply and return fuel lines
are improperly connected to the fuel tank. The suction and return lines may
be mispositioned at the tank or frame pass-through. This problem may
include a corresponding P008A00 fault code.
