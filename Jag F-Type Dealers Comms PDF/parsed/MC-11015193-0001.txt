Page 2 of 3Technical Background
 These faults can result from the low-pressure fuel system operating outside its pressure tolerances. In the 3D 
 model, there is a clearance of approximately 19 mm (See Figure 1). It is possible for the component to vibrate over 
 time, which could lead to the fuel line to be damaged, causing a leak in the fuel line (See Figure 2). 
Service Information
 In cases with the above mentioned faults, please replace the low pressure fuel pump in accordance with the infor-
 mation in the table below.
