This bulletin has been developed in response to a small number of customer concerns regarding 
fluid seepage found coming from the CVT assembly.  Investigation has identified likely sources of 
the seepage to be the sealant used on the CVT’s oil pump chain cover and the input shaft oil seal.  
The repair involves chain cover removal, a thorough cleaning and inspection of the sealing surfaces 
followed by re-sealing the cover and replacement of the input shaft oil seal with the new , redesigned 
type. 
PRODUCTION CHANGE INFORMATION:
The available starting VINS for incorporation of the new input shaft oil 
seal are supplied to the right.  This bulletin will be revised with the VINs 
for the remaining applicable models as they become available.

SERVICE PROCEDURE / INFORMATION:
As a first step, during inspection of the customer’s concern, confirm the fluid found to be seeping is 
CVT fluid (CVTF) and not engine oil.  The photos below are examples of where CVTF seepage may 
be evident.Model Starting VIN

• Once the inspection has confirmed the seepage is CVTF, remove the CVT assembly  
following the procedure outlined in the applicable Service Manual. The Service Manual uses 
a black star ( ) in the component breakdown illustrations to indicate one-time use parts.
• CAREFULLY remove the torque converter from the CVT and inspect the area of the oil 
pump chain cover as indicated in the photo below for any accumulation of CVTF and road 
dirt which may also have collected in the area.
NOTE:  A small amount of fresh CVT fluid may appear near the 6:00 position of the seal area during 
removal of the torque converter (GREEN circle).

Oil Pump Chain Cover Re-Sealing (TR690) & (TR580):
• Remove the 7- (TR690) or 10- (TR580) 12mm hex bolts securing the oil pump chain cover .

• Using a prying tool, CAREFULLY pry (GREEN arrows IN THE ORDER SHOWN for 
TR690 model) the cover loose from the housing.  Pry ONLY on the specific areas or “tabs” 
of the pump cover indicated by the BLUE arrows.  When the cover starts to come loose, con -
tinue to pry ONLY on the tabs and not the machined sealing surface of the cover.

TR690 ONLY
Check the mating surface of the converter case cover for CVT fluid seepage. 
• If CVT fluid is found leaking in this area, remove and re-seal the converter case cover. Refer 
to the “ Converter Case Cover Re-Sealing” section of this bulletin. If NO CVT fluid is 
found leaking in this area, continue with the procedures for re-sealing the oil pump chain 
cover.
Converter Case Cover Re-Sealing (TR690 ONLY):
• Remove the 5 – 12mm hex bolts securing the converter case in a crossing pattern. 
• Using a prying tool, CAREFULLY pry the cover loose. Pry ONLY on the specific areas or 
“tabs” of the converter case cover. Once the cover is loose, continue to pry only on the tabs 
and not the machined sealing surfaces.

• Remove and replace the two one-time use o-rings (806916060).

• IMPORTANT: Always confirm the front reduction drive gear shim stays with the converter 
case cover when removing and prior to re-installation.
• CAREFULLY remove all residual sealant completely from the cover and mating surface of 
the housing. DO NOT use any abrasive or gasket removal / cleaning discs. Use the adhesive 
side of a piece of duct tape (or equivalent) to pick up any loose pieces of sealant material 
which may be found in the cavity around the stator support. DO NOT use compressed air.
• Inspect both of the machined sealing surfaces closely for irregularities. If necessary , replace 
the cover following the applicable Service Manual Procedures. The Service Manual uses a 
black star ( ) in the component breakdown illustrations to indicate one-time use parts.
• Remove and replace the one-time use o-ring (31377AA550).

• CAREFULLY apply the new sealant bead to the converter case cover along the edge of the 
chamfer as shown 
NOTE: As shown above, a properly applied, small bead of sealant will fill in the chamfered portion 
after the cover is installed. Do not use an excessive amount of sealant.
• Install the converter case case cover. Install the 5 – 12mm hex bolts and torque to 24Nm 
(17.7 ft.lbs) in a crossing pattern.
Oil Pump Chain Cover Re-Sealing (TR690) & (TR580) Continued:
• CAREFULLY remove all residual sealant completely 
from the cover and mating surface of the housing.  DO 
NOT  use any abrasive or gasket removal / cleaning 
discs.  Use the adhesive side of a piece of duct tape 
(or equivalent) to pick up any loose pieces of sealant 
material which may be found in the cavity around the 
stator support.  DO NOT  use compressed air.

• Take note of how the sealant on the removed cover forms an additional “seal” when it  
becomes displaced into the chamfer around the inside edge of the case’ s machined surface  
at assembly.
 
• Inspect both of the machined sealing surfaces closely for irregularities.  If necessary , replace 
the cover following the applicable Service Manual procedures. The Service Manual uses a 
black star ( ) in the component breakdown illustrations to indicate one-time use parts.
• NOTE:  Should the cover need to be replaced, always confirm the new part has the new-style 
input shaft seal with the additional side lip as described below before installation.
• IMPORTANT:  Before reassembly, always replace the ONE TIME USE plastic sealing ring 
on the center support and thoroughly lubricate it with CVT fluid.
  
• The re-designed input shaft oil seal has a new side lip added 
to supplement the existing main seal lip. The purpose of the 
additional side lip is to direct the flow of dust and water around the 
seal and away from the sealing surfaces.
• Apply CVT fluid to the main seal lip only before installation.
• When installing this new seal, it is STRONGLY recommended 
to use the proper installer tool **OPTIONAL Special Tool 
927890000 as shown in the illustration below.  Otherwise, If the 
seal were to be installed too deep into the bore of the chain cover 
(beyond flush with the chain cover edge as shown below), the oil 
passage may become restricted or blocked.

Oil Seal is installed flush 
with edge of chain cover 
and oil passage is clear.
• Once both surfaces and the area surrounding the cover are completely clean, dry and the new 
input seal is properly installed, CAREFULLY apply the new sealant bead to the cover along 
the edge of the chamfer as shown below.
   
   
        
DO NOT apply sealer

• On the TR690, there are 2 different length bolts for the pump cover.  Make sure the proper 
length bolts ( A and B) are in their respective holes as shown below.  Torque to  
24 Nm (17.7 ft. lbs) in a crossing pattern.
               
        
                    
• For the TR580 (all 10 cover bolts are the same length), apply the sealer, (EXCEPT for the 
arrowed hole), reinstall the cover and torque the bolts to 21 Nm (15.5 ft. lbs.) in a crossing 
pattern. 
• CAREFULLY reinstall the torque converter and the CVT assembly in reverse order of 
removal following the service procedure in the applicable Service Manual. The Service 
Manual uses a black star ( ) in the component breakdown illustrations to indicate one-time 
use parts.
• Road test to confirm the repair and proper vehicle operation.
