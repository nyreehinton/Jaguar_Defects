Introduction  
Some  2022 – 2025 model year Lexus vehicles  may require the download and installation of  
vehicle specific software or configuration software when the Electronic Control Unit  (ECU ) is 
replaced. GTS+  software has been modified to indicate when configuration software is required. A  
new Configure  column has been  added to the GTS+  Health Check Resu lts screen to show when 
configuration software is available for a specific ECU.  
 
Follow the Operation Procedure  in this bulletin to complete the ECU Software Configure Process.  
Certain ECU replacements require CUW reprogramming (Standard ECU Configuration ) while  
others may only require C -Best Writing (ECU Configuration Value Writing). Please select the  
appropriate procedure below, depending on the ECU replaced.  
 Procedure A: Standard ECU Configuration (CUW Reprogramming)  
 Procedure B: ECU Configuration Value Writing (Body and Brake ECU Only)  
 
 
Refer to the applicability chart below for a list of Models and ECUs that will require configuration  
software when the specified ECU is replaced:

NOTE  
On some models, DTCs may be set as a result of  reprogramming. If DTCs are present, clear them, 
and run the Health Check again. Troubleshoot ANY remaining current, pending, or history codes. 
Permanent codes will NOT be cleared using GTS+. Permanent codes do NOT illuminate the MIL and 
do NOT require tro ubleshooting. They will clear during normal driving once the Universal Trip Drive 
Pattern is performed.
