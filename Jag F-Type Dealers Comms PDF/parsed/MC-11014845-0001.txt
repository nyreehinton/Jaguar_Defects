 SUBJECT: Click/Crack Sound from Front  
  Lower Control Arm
INTRODUCTION: 
This bulletin announces the design change made to the front lower control arms developed to address 
cases of a click or cracking type sound heard when moving forward or backward at low speed 
with the steering wheel fully turned position. This is caused by the coarse surface of the lower arm 
allowing slight movement of the outer portion of the bushing. The new arms have a smooth finish 
on the contact surface providing an increased fixed positioning of the bushing. If this is reported by 
a customer and can be duplicated, replace the affected lower control arm using the part information 
supplied in this bulletin.
DESCRIPTION OF DESIGN CHANGE:
PRODUCTION CHANGE INFORMATION:
The new control arm assemblies have been incorporated into vehicle production as per staring  VIN 
R9814013.ATTENTION:
