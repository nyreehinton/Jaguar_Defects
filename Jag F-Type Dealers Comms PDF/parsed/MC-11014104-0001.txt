SERVICE:
The HLCM might have set a fail-safe flag. There is a script in VIDA where you can see if the fail-safe 
flag is active and recover the fail-safe flag if it’s active. 
Follow the steps in PDF “TJ_37207_1” to check and recover the fail-safe flag. If the fail-safe flag is 
still active after step 8 in the PDF “TJ_37207_1” the HLCM needs to be replaced.
