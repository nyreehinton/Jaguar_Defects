Campaign No.:  CA DMV No.:  Campaign Desc.:  Apply An Additional VECI Label  2025010004  N/A  24P5891749  
This is to notify you of an Emission Service Campaign  to apply an additional VECI Label on 70,052 Model Year (“MY”) 20 22-2024 
EQE and EQS ( 294, 295, 296, and 297 platform s) veh icles. The affected v ehicles will be visible and flagged in VMI as “OPEN” on

Background  
Issue  Mercedes -Benz AG (“MBAG”), the manufacturer of Mercedes -Benz, has determined 
that on certain  MY 20 22-2024 EQE and EQS (294, 295, 296, and 297 platforms) 
vehicles, the Vehicle Emissions Control Information (VECI) label in the engine 
compartment may not be readily visible to a customer, since the Operator’s Manual 
directs that only workshop personnel are permitted to open the hood.  
What We’re Doing  MBUSA will conduct an Emission Service Campaign. An authorized Mercedes -Benz 
dealer will  apply an additional VECI Label on the driver’s door of affected vehicles, 
so that the label is readily visible to the customer. Affected customers will be notified 
via First Class letter to have the additional VECI label on the driver’s door of their 
vehicles. 
Parts The remedy  is available and can be performed as necessary.
