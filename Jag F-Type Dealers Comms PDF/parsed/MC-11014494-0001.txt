Spring Brake Chamber Breather 870 
Date: May 2014

Introduction 
 
This bulletin has been issued to inform customers of the availability of an actuator by-pass 
breather kit for Wabco Spring Brake Chambers. Part Numbers 441331 & 440675. These 
chambers were used on chassis number 1829 onwards and also buses originally fitted with MGM actuators but converted as per Service Bulletin 763-2.  In the event that air systems are not fully charged before attempting to move off the spring brakes may remain lightly applied. The kit has been released to reduce the likelihood of 
this, and prevent the brake from binding when v ehicles are first driven each day. It will also 
add a level of protection in the event of internal leakage of spring brake which is too slight to be detected during normal maintenance checks. 
 
Kit Details 
 
The kit is listed under ADL Part Number 660883-2. Check availability with your local 
Parts Centre. 
 
 
ENSURE THAT AIR PRESSURE IS EXHAUSTED FROM THE BRAKE SYSTEM 
BEFORE ATTEMPTING TO FIT BREATHER KIT. THE WORK MUST BE CARRIED OUT BY QUALIFIED WORKSHOP PERSONNEL. 
 
 
Instructions 
 
Refer to fig 1. 
 
1. Remove all dirt deposits on the brake chamber in the area where breather is to be fitted. 2. Remove and discard the plug (item 1) from rear of chamber. 
3. Assembly washer (item 3) onto adapter (item 2). 
4. Screw assembled adapter into hole where plug was removed from. Tighten to 7 
± 1 Nm. 
5. Push breather pipe (item 5) secured with clip (item4) onto adapter (item 3). 
6. Secure breather in place on side of chamber using strap (item 6). Tighten to 0.5 ± 0.1 Nm 
7. Fit breather to other spring brake chamber following instructions. 
8. Charge air brake system and check brake f unction correctly before returning vehicle to 
service.

Actuator  
This bulletin has been re-issued to inform oper ators that MGM type br ake actuators are no 
longer available. If a vehicle fitted with MGM type actuators r equires a replacement 
actuator, then kit no SL2099 must be used. Check with Alexander Dennis Parts for 
availability. Trident 3’s are not affected as stated on previous Service Bulletin 763. 
 The kit facilitates the fitting of Wabco 30/30 type actuators in place of the previous MGM 
units. The kit contains all necessary parts to  install the Wabco act uators on both the drive 
and auxiliary axle.  Important Note:  MGM and Wabco actuators must not be mixed on a vehicle and it is 
essential that if an original  MGM actuator is being replaced with a Wabco unit, all 4 
actuators on drive and auxiliary axles are changed and that the modifi cations are carried 
out to the air brake system to maintain vehicle road legality.

Instructions 
1. Ensure that the all appropriate safety measures are observed while working on the 
vehicle &  ensure that adequate height is available before raising the vehicle and 
supporting the vehicle on stands. Ensure that all air pressure is exhausted from 
brake and suspension system before commencing work. 
 2. While supporting the drive axle, slack en and remove the air suspension spring lower 
mounting bolts. Insert the Packer (item 1) between the suspension plate and the air 
spring suspension piston. Secure in  position using bolts (item 2).  
 
 
 
 
3. Disconnect air line connections at rear ac tuators. Remove clevis pin from actuating 
arms. Slacken and remove actuator m ounting nuts and remove actuators from 
mounting brackets. On the drive axle only remove the actuator mounting brackets. 
 
4. Mount new actuator m ounting brackets (item 5) left hand and (item 6) right hand 
onto the drive axle. 
 
5. Loosen outer locknut on slack adjuster cont rol arm brackets (View A). Ensure that a 
second spanner is used to hold the inner locknut  in position. It is vital that no side 
loading is placed on the arm. Repeat this  operation for slack adjusters on Tag and 
drive axles.

6. Fit a half nut (item 7) to the actuator pushrod, then fit clevis and adjust so that rod 
end is approximately level with the inside fa ce of the clevis. This should give a 
dimension of 76mm from the ce ntre of the clevis mounti ng hole to the mounting face 
of the actuator. (View B). Tight en half nut to lock clevis in this position.  Repeat this 
operation for all replacement actuators. 
  
 
 
 
7. Bolt the actuator to t he mounting bracket. (Item 12) dr ive axle, (item 11) tag axle. 
Ensure that the yoke hole is centred on t he slack adjuster hole.  If not, the position 
of the slack adjuster should be altered by turning the adjuster hex one or two clicks 
until the holes coincide.

8. When the hole is correctly aligned a ssemble as shown in (View C). Repeat 
operation for remaining actuators. 
  
 
 
 
  
9. After tightening clevis pin nut secure with split pin. Push the control arm bracket as 
far downwards as possible before retightening  the outer locknut. Hold inner locknut 
with a spanner to prevent t wisting of the control arm. 
 
 
10. Remove air fittings shown in Air Brak e System - Before modification diagram. 
Relocate Quick release valve to under stairs  outrigger position.  Fit items (8 Tee),  
(9 Elbow) and (10 Connector) as shown in th e Air Brake System - After modification 
diagram and pipe as shown in diagram. 
  
The new actuators are internal breathing act uators, the clear breat her tube from the old 
actuators that was connected to  the Quick Release Valve shou ld be removed. Cut a short 
length of this breather pipe and us e it to connect the QRV breathe r stubs together in a loop to 
prevent the ingress of di rt into the valve.
