ConditionThis PI will explain the front drive unit and (or) rear drive unit
(s) and their components are on restriction for above listed EV
vehicles.   
This program is to gather important feedback on these new
drive units.  
This document will be revised to remove vehicle model at time
of restriction end for that vehicle at a later dates.
CauseProduct teams continually seek valuable information for
engineering improvements.  
To assist in this eﬀort the restriction program will be used for
this product.   
It is imperative that freeze frame failure records be captured
along with DTC's and not cleared.

Correction:
The vehicles listed above with EV front and/or rear drive units and their components are
subject to restriction, which will be managed by the GM T echnical Assistance Center (T AC).
To proceed, the servicing high-voltage-trained technician must provide detailed
information, including customer comments, vehicle conditions, diagnostic trouble codes
(DTCs), and any other relevant details.
To request restricted components, dealerships are required to call T echnical Assistance
(TAC). 
Prior to calling T AC, please read through this entire document.  
If diagnosis leads to replacement of one or more of the restricted components, please have
all SI document numbers used during diagnosis available prior to contacting T AC.
Note: Please attach the GDS2 session logs to the case per the lasted version of PIP5632  
Do not clear codes until after you review the case with T AC. 
Will need Serial number that is stamped in to the left side of the Drive unit. 
TAC Telephone Number US 1-877-446-8227 (Action Center prompt or Hybrid prompt)

Danger: Alwa ys perform the High V oltage Disabling procedure prior to servicing any High
Voltage component or connection. Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) and proper
procedures must be followed. 
With the High V oltage Disabling procedure you will perform the following tasks:   
   • Identify how to disable high voltage.
   • Identify how to test for the presence of high voltage.
   • Identify condition under which high voltage is alwa ys present and personal protection
equipment (PPE) and proper procedures must be followed.
Before working on any high voltage system, be sure to wear the following Personal
Protection Equipment:   
   • Safety glasses with appropriate side shields when within 50 feet of the vehicle, either
indoors or outdoors.
   • Certiﬁed and up-to-date Class "0" Insulation gloves rated at 1000V with leather
protectors.
   • V isually and functionally inspect the gloves before use.
   • W ear the Insulation gloves at all times when working with the Drive Motor Battery
assembly , whether the system is energized or not. F ailure to follow the procedures exactly
as written ma y result in serious injury or death.
   1. Perform the high voltage disable procedure at the drive motor generator control
module assembly or cable connections. Refer to High V oltage Disabling in SI.  
   2. Perform the high voltage enable procedure when the replacement drive unit
is installed and ready to be test driven.
