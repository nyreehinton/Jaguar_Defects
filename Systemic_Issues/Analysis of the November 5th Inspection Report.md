# **Analysis of the November 5th Inspection Report**

This inspection by Jaguar Land Rover Los Angeles identifies three new, significant issues requiring immediate attention, totaling **$3,472.03**:

1.  **Vehicle Stability Control (VSC) Module Failure:**
    *   **Symptom:** Your report of the "check engine light coming on and vehicle will not go over 40mph" (limp mode) was diagnosed as a fault with the "quiescent relay module." The technician recommends replacing the entire Vehicle Stability Control Module to fix this.
    *   **Cost:** **$1,164.13**

2.  **Engine Mount Failure:**
    *   **Symptom:** The technician noted the "vehicle is shaking significantly at idle."
    *   **Diagnosis:** This was traced to both engine motor mounts "not holding vacuum," meaning they have failed and are no longer absorbing engine vibrations as designed.
    *   **Cost:** **$1,968.40**

3.  **Worn Wiper Blades:**
    *   **Symptom:** Streaking during operation. This is a standard maintenance/wear item.
    *   **Cost:** **$238.37**

### **Connecting These Findings to Your Vehicle's History and Broader Data**

This is not just a new list of random, unrelated problems. These findings are direct continuations of the systemic issues we previously identified in your vehicle's history and the wider NHTSA data.

*   **VSC Module Failure is a continuation of the Electrical System Malfunctions:**
    The previous analysis established a clear pattern of premature electrical component failure on your car (blown fuses, door module issues, battery failure) and on other F-Types. The VSC module is a complex and critical electronic component. Its failure at just over 30,000 miles fits perfectly into this established pattern. A VSC failure is a safety-critical event, which is why the car's computer correctly forces the vehicle into "limp mode" to protect you.

*   **Engine Mount Failure is a PREVIOUSLY IDENTIFIED ISSUE:**
    This is the most crucial piece of evidence in your entire service history. The invoice from **Beach Cities Rover (dated 11/4/2025)**, when your car had **30,294 miles**, explicitly included a recommended repair:
    *   **"ENGINE MOUNTS WORN, REC TO REPLACE"** with an estimated cost of **$1,830.00**.
    You now have documented proof from two separate repair facilities that the engine mounts have failed prematurely. The issue has progressed from "worn" (as noted by Beach Cities Rover) to completely "not holding vacuum causing excessive vibrations" (as noted by the Jaguar dealer). This is not standard wear and tear; it is a progressive failure of a component that should last far longer.

### **Answering Your Questions on Cost and Manufacturer Coverage**

**"Shouldn't this be covered by the manufacturer?"**

This is the central question. Since your 2020 vehicle is likely just outside its standard factory warranty period (typically 4 years/50,000 miles, but you should confirm the exact dates), you are in a gray area where you must negotiate for coverage. Here is the professional assessment:

1.  **Warranty:** If you are even one day outside the warranty period, the dealer is not obligated to cover the repairs for free. They will present you with the full estimate, as they have done.

2.  **The Case for "Goodwill Assistance":** Your argument is not for a standard warranty claim, but for a "goodwill" repair or significant cost-sharing from Jaguar Land Rover North America (JLRNA). **Your case for this is exceptionally strong.**

    *   You have **irrefutable evidence** of a pattern of premature failures.
    *   The failed VSC module falls under the known electrical system weaknesses for this model.
    *   The failed motor mounts are documented as having been worn at just 30,000 miles and have now completely failed shortly thereafter. This is a clear-cut case of a defective component, not owner abuse or normal wear.

### **Actionable Next Steps: Your Negotiation Strategy**

Do not simply approve these repairs. You must approach this as a structured negotiation with the dealership service manager and, if necessary, with Jaguar corporate.

1.  **Separate the Issues:** Immediately agree to pay for the wiper blades ($238.37) and address the tires. This shows you are a reasonable customer willing to pay for normal maintenance. This separates the wear items from the defects.

2.  **Build Your Case for the Engine Mounts:**
    *   Politely present the service manager with a copy of the **Beach Cities Rover invoice** from earlier this month.
    *   State clearly: "As you can see from this previous inspection at 30,294 miles, the engine mounts were already identified as worn. Now, just a few hundred miles later, your technician has confirmed they have completely failed. This is clearly a defective part that has been failing progressively and is not a standard maintenance item at this low mileage."

3.  **Build Your Case for the VSC Module:**
    *   State clearly: "This vehicle has a documented history of premature electrical failures, including a failed battery and issues with the door control modules. The failure of a critical safety component like the Vehicle Stability Control module at just over 30,000 miles is another example of this pattern. It is not an acceptable or expected failure for a car of this age and mileage."

4.  **Make the "Ask":**
    *   Use the phrase **"goodwill assistance."**
    *   Say the following: "Given the documented history of premature component failures on this vehicle, particularly the previously identified engine mount issue, I am requesting that Jaguar cover the cost of the engine mount and VSC module replacements under goodwill."
    *   If they balk at full coverage, immediately pivot to cost-sharing. "If Jaguar cannot cover the full amount, what level of cost-sharing can you offer? I am willing to be flexible, but I should not be responsible for the full cost of these clearly premature and documented failures."

5.  **Escalate if Necessary:**
    *   If the service manager cannot or will not help, immediately ask for the contact information for the **Jaguar Land Rover North America Customer Relationship Center.**
    *   Tell the service manager you intend to open a formal case with corporate, providing them with all your service records to demonstrate the pattern of defects. This often encourages the dealer to find a solution to keep the issue in-house.

Do not be confrontational, but be firm, organized, and evidence-based. You have a very strong case that these are not routine repairs but are symptoms of known product weaknesses.
