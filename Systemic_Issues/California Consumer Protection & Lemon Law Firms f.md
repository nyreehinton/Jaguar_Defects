### Key Considerations for Your Case

Your situation presents strong claims for:

1. **Breach of Warranty Service Obligations** - Dealerships failed to perform repairs in a workmanlike manner and didn't follow manufacturer bulletins[^1]
2. **Service Negligence** - Multiple documented instances where dealerships ignored or improperly applied manufacturer directives (H291, H299, JLRTB02030)[^1]
3. **Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act (California Lemon Law)** - Recurring defects that substantially impair use, value, or safety, with multiple repair attempts[^20][^53]

Most California lemon law attorneys work on **contingency fee basis** with **no upfront costs**. Under California law, if you prevail, the manufacturer pays your attorney fees and costs.[^18][^50][^45]

### Next Steps

Contact multiple firms for free consultations. Provide them with:

- Your detailed service negligence analysis document[^1]
- All dealership service records and invoices
- The comprehensive diagnostic scan results (33 DTCs across 18 modules)
- Documentation of Jaguar Service Actions H291 and H299 that were never performed

Given your documented evidence showing dealerships failed to follow explicit manufacturer repair procedures, you have a particularly strong case for both breach of warranty and service negligence claims.
