1.0 Chronological Service & Repair History

The following section presents a detailed, time-ordered log of the vehicle's service history. Each entry builds upon the last to construct a clear narrative of reported issues, diagnostic processes, and the corresponding actions taken by service professionals. This chronological approach is essential for understanding the evolution of the vehicle's condition and identifying recurring patterns that may indicate underlying systemic issues.

1.1 Service Event: October 2024

* Date: October 2024
* Service Center: Jaguar Land Rover South Bay & Jaguar Land Rover Los Angeles
* Mileage In/Out: 23,072 / 23,282
* Invoice(s): #908960, #824373

Customer Reported Concern(s) The owner reported a series of electrical failures, including the driver's side window not rolling up and a complete loss of function for the driver's side door electronics. Additionally, a "low battery" warning light was illuminated on the instrument cluster.

Technician's Diagnostic Findings The diagnostic process occurred across two separate service centers.

* Initial Diagnosis (Jaguar Land Rover South Bay): The technician first identified a blown fuse for the driver door module. Upon replacing the fuse, it immediately blew again, confirming a persistent short to ground in the circuit.
* In-Depth Diagnosis (Jaguar Land Rover Los Angeles): A more thorough investigation followed a meticulous diagnostic path. The technician checked the circuit from the driver door module to the rear junction box and then from the left engine junction box to the rear junction box. This process isolated the fault, revealing a circuit short in the left engine junction box and determining high resistance in a harness located under the carpet, specifically between points C1318A and C1BB01A-15, where a short to ground was found.
* Battery Diagnostics: The "low battery" warning was investigated, revealing Diagnostic Trouble Code (DTC) U3003-16 stored in the system. A comprehensive in-vehicle battery test was performed, which the battery failed. To confirm, the battery was removed and tested again out-of-vehicle, and it failed a second time.

Actions & Repairs Performed

* The compromised section of the wiring harness under the carpet was professionally repaired to eliminate the short circuit.
* The driver door trim and luggage compartment trim, which were removed for diagnostic access, were refitted. All related trouble codes were cleared from the vehicle's memory.
* The failed battery was replaced with a new unit, and the vehicle's Battery Monitoring System (BMS) was reset. This action successfully cleared the "low battery" warning message from the instrument cluster.

Additional Notes & Observations

* A multi-point inspection and a tire pressure service were also performed during these visits.
* The customer declined two recommended services at the South Bay location: replacement of "Aftermarket rear brake pads/shoes" and a "B151A064000 Service" (64,000 Miles Service).
* The client requested a new SIM card for the vehicle's telematics system; however, the part was noted as "currently out of stock."

1.2 Service Event: November 2024

* Date: November 15-21, 2024
* Service Center: Jaguar Land Rover Los Angeles
* Mileage In/Out: 23,915 / 23,964
* Invoice(s): #825649, #825556

Customer Reported Concern(s) The primary complaint was the illumination of the "low coolant warning light." The customer also noted that the vehicle's factory warranty had expired on November 8, 2024, just prior to this visit.

Technician's Diagnostic Findings Technicians performed a pressure test on the engine cooling system. The test revealed a leak originating from the bleed pipe where it connects to the coolant expansion tank.

Actions & Repairs Performed

* To rectify the leak, the expansion tank bleed pipe (Part #T2R47919 HOSE) was removed and replaced with a new component.
* The cooling system was then vacuum-filled with new antifreeze (Part #T2H59152) to the manufacturer-specified level.
* A post-repair test drive confirmed that the system was holding pressure and no further leaks were present. The total cost for this repair was $294.62.

Additional Notes & Observations

* An initial work order (#825556) indicates the client first brought the vehicle in on November 15th but elected to take it before the repair was completed, returning at a later date to have the work performed.
* The Multi-Point Inspection conducted during this visit identified several items requiring service:
  * Needs Immediate Attention:
    * Inspect air cleaner element
    * Replace Cabin Air Filter (noted as CONTAMINATED)
    * Rear Brake Linings measured at 3mm
    * Oil Service recommended (oil noted as LOW AND DIRTY)
    * Rear Camera Misalignment
  * Needs Attention Soon:
    * Front Brake Linings measured at 4mm

1.3 Service Event: August 2025

* Date: August 25-29, 2025
* Service Center: West Adams Radiator & Jaguar Land Rover Los Angeles (Parts Dept.)
* Mileage: 28,769 (at JLR) / 28,812 (at West Adams Radiator)
* Invoice(s): West Adams Invoice, Jaguar Parts Invoices #10544 & #CM10544, JLR Work Order #100821

Customer Reported Concern(s) The service history suggests a specific sequence of events. The owner first presented the vehicle at the Jaguar Land Rover Los Angeles dealership (Work Order #100821) on August 25th with three concerns: a recurring "low coolant warning," an active "brake pad warning," and a request to replace the air filters.

Actions & Repairs Performed Following the dealership visit, the owner appears to have opted for an independent repair for the most pressing issue.

1. The owner procured parts directly from the Jaguar Land Rover Los Angeles parts department on August 26th, purchasing a hose (T2R47919), a supercharger water pump/separator assembly (JDE41599), and a SIM card (C2D4195).
2. The vehicle was then taken to West Adams Radiator, an independent facility, for the repair. Technicians at this shop removed and replaced the expansion tank hose and the supercharger water pump, utilizing the customer-supplied parts. The total cost for labor and fluids was $681.16.

Additional Notes & Observations

* The invoice from West Adams Radiator explicitly states: "CUSTOMER PARTS NO WARRANTY."
* A subsequent parts receipt from Jaguar Land Rover Los Angeles, dated August 29, 2025, shows a "WARRANTY SWAP REFUND" was issued for the hose (part T2R47919) for a credit of $121.57. This suggests the owner may have initially purchased an incorrect or defective part and had to exchange it to complete the repair.

This documented history of repeated, and ultimately independent, repairs to the cooling system, alongside the initial complex electrical faults, paints a picture of a vehicle with systemic issues that require the deeper diagnostic analysis that follows.

2.0 Comprehensive Vehicle Health Analysis (As of Late 2025)

This section provides a detailed analysis of the vehicle's electronic and systemic health, based on a comprehensive diagnostic scan and an onboard monitor test performed after the most recent repairs. This data offers critical insight into the vehicle's underlying condition beyond what is visible externally, revealing both active and historical faults logged by the onboard computer systems.

2.1 Diagnostic Trouble Code (DTC) Analysis

* Scan Date: August 27, 2025
* Odometer: 28,812.36 miles

The diagnostic scan revealed a significant number of electronic faults, with 33 total faults found across 18 electronic control modules. This high fault count points toward systemic issues rather than isolated component failures.

Critical Permanent Faults

Permanent faults indicate active and persistent problems that are currently failing self-checks and require immediate diagnostic attention. Two such faults were present:

* Gateway Module 'A' (GWM): DTC B1412-96 (Permanent): Quiescent relay box - Component internal fault. This is the most critical fault identified. The Gateway Module acts as the central router for all vehicle communication networks. An internal fault in this core component is the likely root cause of the widespread communication errors observed across other modules.
* Passenger Front Seat Module (PSM): DTC U3001-46 (Permanent): Control module improper shutdown (voltage related). This fault suggests the module lost power incorrectly, a condition often linked to a past low-voltage event, such as the documented battery failure in October 2024.

Widespread Communication Failures

Numerous modules reported communication "U" codes, indicating a network-level breakdown. Errors were found on the High-Speed CAN Bus—which is critical for powertrain, chassis, and safety systems—as well as on other data buses. These widespread errors strongly support the conclusion that the permanent fault in the Gateway Module (GWM) is the primary disruption, creating instability across the vehicle's entire electronic architecture.

Powertrain and Cooling System Faults (Historical)

The Powertrain Control Module (PCM) logged two significant historical faults related to the cooling system:

* P2B61-73: Engine coolant flow control valve stuck closed.
* P26CB-72: Variable coolant pump performance/stuck off - Actuator stuck open.

Although logged as "History," the presence of these specific codes indicates that the vehicle has previously experienced a malfunction in its sophisticated variable cooling system. This finding directly correlates with the vehicle's repeated service visits for coolant-related warnings.

Other System Faults

The scan identified several other problem areas, including:

* Body Control Module (BCM): Historical faults for both front turn signals and "Unknown" status faults related to the power steering column adjustments.
* Audio Amplifier Module (AAM): Four distinct faults indicating circuit shorts to ground and battery in Speaker #13 and Speaker #14.
* Module Configuration Issues: The Power Steering Control Module (PSCM) and Image Processing Module 'B' (IPMB) both reported missing configuration or calibration data, which may impact their functionality.

2.2 Onboard Monitor (Mode 6) Test Analysis

* Test Date: October 18, 2025

The Mode 6 test accesses raw data from the vehicle's onboard self-diagnostic routines, providing a pass/fail status for key emissions and powertrain components before a fault is severe enough to trigger a check engine light. The test revealed a critical failure.

While key systems such as the Catalyst, EVAP, and Oxygen Sensor monitors all reported a "Pass" status, the VVT Monitor Bank 1 reported a "Complete and Fail" status.

The specific data point that triggered the failure is as follows:

Test ID: 80 Value: -58.95 ° Minimum Limit: 40.99 ° Maximum Limit: -58.89 °

This result indicates that a measured value within the engine's Variable Valve Timing (VVT) system is outside the manufacturer's specified acceptable range. This is not an intermittent or historical code; it is a confirmed, active fault within a critical engine system.

These diagnostic findings can be contextualized by cross-referencing them with known issues and repair bulletins published by the manufacturer.

3.0 Applicable Manufacturer Communications (Technical Service Bulletins)

This section correlates the vehicle's specific service history and diagnostic faults with official communications issued by Jaguar, known as Special Service Messages (SSMs) or Technical Service Bulletins (TSBs). This analysis provides crucial context for recurring issues and identifies potential factory-authorized repair paths that may be available.

JLRTB02030NAS1 / H291	A loud noise from the engine compartment caused by the cooling fan running at high speed. The root cause is the coolant diversion shroud inside the variable coolant pump not moving to the correct position. This stores DTCs P2B61-73 and P26CB-72.	Direct Correlation: The vehicle's diagnostic scan from Aug. 2025 recorded these exact historical DTCs. This indicates the vehicle has experienced the precise fault described in this bulletin, which aligns with its history of coolant system repairs.
JLRTB02023NAS2 / H299	Malfunction Indicator Lamp (MIL) illumination with various camshaft position DTCs (P0011-71, P000A-00, etc.) stored. The cause is "insufficient wear resistance of the Variable Camshaft Timing (VCT) solenoid bush."	Direct Correlation: The vehicle's Mode 6 test from Oct. 2025 shows a hard failure in the VVT Monitor. This bulletin addresses a known cause for VVT system faults in this specific engine and model year range.
SSM 74570	"Low battery message" on the instrument panel, potentially caused by the Incontrol touch head unit intermittently waking the CAN bus and causing a battery drain.	High Correlation: The vehicle required a battery replacement in Oct. 2024 due to a failed battery test and a "low battery" warning light, matching the symptoms described.
SSM 74490 / MC-10171142-0001	No audio output or popping/crackling noises from the audio system, potentially caused by an Infotainment Master Controller (IMC) hardware failure or software issue.	High Correlation: The vehicle's diagnostic scan from Aug. 2025 identified multiple faults in the Audio Amplifier Module (AAM) related to speaker circuit shorts, indicating a problem within the audio system as described in the bulletins.

4.0 Summary of Findings

This comprehensive review of the service invoices, diagnostic data, and manufacturer bulletins reveals several significant patterns and outstanding issues with this 2020 Jaguar F-Type.

* Recurring Cooling System Issues: The vehicle has undergone repeated repairs for coolant system warnings, including replacement of a coolant hose in November 2024 and the supercharger water pump in August 2025. The presence of historical fault codes P2B61-73 and P26CB-72 directly links these symptoms to a known manufacturer issue detailed in Technical Bulletin JLRTB02030NAS1 (Service Action H291).
* Chronic Electrical & Network Faults: A significant electrical repair was performed in October 2024 to fix a shorted harness, which coincided with a complete battery failure. The August 2025 diagnostic scan reveals that deep-seated electrical problems persist, highlighted by a critical, permanent internal fault in the Gateway Module (GWM). This GWM failure is the most likely source of the widespread communication errors and ongoing network instability within the vehicle.
* Confirmed Powertrain Fault: The vehicle has a confirmed, active fault in the Variable Valve Timing (VVT) system, as evidenced by the failed Mode 6 monitor test conducted in October 2025. This is a critical engine performance issue and directly corresponds to the known VVT solenoid problem described by Jaguar in Technical Bulletin JLRTB02023NAS2 (Service Action H299).
* Deferred Maintenance: Based on the multi-point inspection from November 2024, the vehicle is overdue for several services. Items needing immediate attention included front and rear brakes, an oil service, replacement of the engine air and cabin air filters, and realignment of the rear camera.
