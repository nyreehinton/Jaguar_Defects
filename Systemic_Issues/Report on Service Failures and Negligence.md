Having established the key entities, the following section will provide a detailed examination of the vehicle's service timeline at the authorized dealerships.

3.0 Chronological Analysis of Dealership Service Encounters

A chronological review of service records is critical to revealing the recurring nature of unresolved issues, the inadequacy of the dealerships' responses, and the escalating severity of the vehicle's faults over time. This timeline of service encounters forms the narrative backbone of the negligence claim, demonstrating a persistent pattern of diagnostic malpractice and a disregard for established repair protocols.

3.1 Service Visit: January 2, 2020 - Jaguar Land Rover South Bay

According to Invoice #908960, the vehicle was presented to Jaguar Land Rover South Bay at 23,072 miles with the complaint that the "drivers side window does not roll up."

The dealership technician's notes document the initial diagnostic steps and a critical finding: "check fuse...and fuse was blown...check ground from junction box to left door control module and there was a short to ground. replace blown fuse and it blew again."

Despite the fuse blowing a second time—a definitive sign of a persistent and undiagnosed electrical short circuit—the invoice concludes with the statement that the system "is now working as it should." This visit marks the first documented instance of an unresolved electrical fault being closed out by a Jaguar dealership without a proper root-cause diagnosis and repair.

3.2 Service Visit: September 30 - October 14, 2024 - Jaguar Land Rover Los Angeles

The vehicle was brought to Jaguar Land Rover Los Angeles at 23,278 miles with two primary complaints: the non-operational status of the driver-side electronics and a "low battery warning light" (Invoice #824373).

The dealership's response to the electronics issue mirrored the 2020 visit. A technician found fuse RF 08 in the rear junction box was blown and recorded the following damning admission in the service notes: "BLEW FUSE RF08 AGAIN AFTER DRIVER ELECTRONICS STOPPER WORKING." A subsequent harness repair was performed. For the battery complaint, a test was performed which the battery failed, leading to its replacement.

This visit represents a significant missed opportunity. While surface-level repairs were performed, the dealership failed to diagnose the underlying root cause of the recurring electrical shorts and the persistent low-voltage conditions that necessitated a new battery. The focus remained on symptoms rather than the systemic problem.

3.3 Service Encounters: November 2024 - The Cooling System Failure

The events of November 2024 mark a critical turning point where the dealership's conduct escalated from inadequate diagnostics to an outright refusal to provide service.

On November 14-15, 2024, the vehicle was brought to Jaguar Land Rover Los Angeles at 23,915 miles with the complaint of a "low coolant warning light" (Work Order #825556). The service advisor's notes are revealing, stating, "CLIENT ATTEMPTED TO BRING THE VEHICLE IN ON 11/07/24 BUT WAS UNABLE TO GET AN APPT UNTIL 11/18/24" and, most critically, "No diag completed client elected to take the vehicle." This documents a refusal by the dealership to perform timely diagnostics on a reported cooling system issue.

The owner returned on November 18-21, 2024 (Invoice #825649, mileage 23,963). This time, the dealership performed a repair, replacing the "expansion tank to bleed pipe." The customer was charged and paid $294.62 for this service.

After initially refusing to perform a diagnosis, the dealership performed a superficial and ultimately incorrect repair for the cooling system failure, charging the customer for a component replacement that failed to address the true underlying problem.

3.4 Service Visit: August 20, 2025 - Jaguar Land Rover Los Angeles

The failure of the previous repair was confirmed when the vehicle returned to Jaguar Land Rover Los Angeles on August 20, 2025, at 28,769 miles (Work Order #100821). The customer's complaint was identical to the one from nine months prior: "low coolant warning coming on." The dealership provided a new repair estimate of $325.88.

This event, demonstrating the complete failure of the November 2024 repair, prompted the owner to seek a competent third-party diagnosis.

4.0 Independent Diagnosis and Definitive Repair

This section contrasts the repeated failures of the authorized Jaguar dealerships with the successful diagnosis and repair performed by an independent specialist. The findings from this independent analysis provide the definitive, data-driven evidence of the vehicle's true condition and identify the correct remedies that the dealerships consistently failed to implement.

4.1 Repair by West Adams Radiator (August 26, 2025)

Just days after leaving the dealership, the vehicle was taken to West Adams Radiator at 28,812 miles. The independent facility correctly diagnosed the cooling system issue and performed the necessary repair, which included:

* REMOVE AND REPLACE JAGUAR-JDE41599-SUPERCHARGER WATER PUMP
* Replacement of the EXPANSION TANK HOSE

The final cost of this successful repair, paid by the customer, was $681.16.

4.2 Comprehensive Vehicle Diagnostic Scan (August 27, 2025)

A comprehensive diagnostic scan was performed on the vehicle at 28,812 miles. The results revealed a vehicle plagued with systemic failures that the dealerships had never identified. Key findings include:

* System-Wide Failures: An alarming 33 total faults across 18 electronic modules were detected, indicating widespread system distress.
* Critical Permanent Fault (GWM): The Gateway Module 'A' (GWM) reported DTC B1412-96, an internal component fault with a "Permanent" status. The diagnostic report identifies this as the "most critical fault" and the "likely root cause of the numerous communication errors" seen across the vehicle's network. This central communication failure is a highly probable root cause for the vehicle's history of inexplicable electrical shorts and recurring blown fuses that were repeatedly left undiagnosed by the dealerships.
* Critical Permanent Fault (PSM): The Passenger Front Seat Module reported DTC U3001-46, a voltage-related improper shutdown failure, also with a "Permanent" status.
* Historical Cooling System Faults: The Powertrain Control Module (PCM) logged two historical, but critically important, Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTCs) that pointed directly to the true cause of the coolant warnings:
  * P2B61-73: "Engine coolant flow control valve stuck closed"
  * P26CB-72: "Variable coolant pump performance/stuck off"

4.3 On-Board Diagnostic Monitor Analysis (October 18, 2025)

A subsequent "Mode 6" report, which analyzes the results of the vehicle's self-diagnostic tests, revealed another critical, unaddressed failure. The "VVT Monitor Bank 1" reported a status of "Complete and Fail," with a recorded value well outside the manufacturer's specified limits.

Together, these independent reports provide incontrovertible evidence of multiple, serious, and long-standing faults. The data confirms a faulty engine coolant pump, a failing central communication module, and a defective variable valve timing system—all of which were either misdiagnosed or completely ignored by authorized Jaguar dealerships across numerous service visits.

5.0 Evidence of Negligence: Failure to Address Known, Documented Defects

Negligence in automotive service is not merely the failure to fix a problem. It is the failure to do so when the manufacturer has already identified the exact problem and provided a specific solution to its authorized service centers. This section will prove that the dealerships' failures were not born of ignorance, but of negligence, by directly linking the vehicle's faults to official Jaguar service directives that were actively ignored at the time of service.

Defect 1: Faulty Variable Coolant Pump

Jaguar officially identified an issue with the cooling systems on these vehicles in TSB JLRTB02030NAS1 and initiated Service Action H291. The manufacturer stated that the "variable coolant pump is not moving to the correct position," which causes the exact DTCs found on Ms. Hinton's vehicle: P2B61-73 and P26CB-72. These are the exact, verbatim fault codes Jaguar specified in its bulletin, making the diagnostic path unequivocal. When Ms. Hinton reported the low coolant warning in November 2024, the dealership was obligated to follow this known diagnostic path. Instead, they ignored the manufacturer's guidance, replaced an unrelated bleed pipe, charged the customer for an ineffective repair, and allowed the vehicle to leave with a known defect.

Defect 2: Faulty Variable Camshaft Timing (VCT) Solenoids

Jaguar initiated Service Action H299 and issued TSB JLRTB02023NAS2 for the 2018-2020 F-Type with the 2.0L Ingenium engine. This known defect, caused by "insufficient wear resistance" in the VCT solenoids, is the direct and predictable cause of the "Complete and Fail" status for the VVT Monitor identified in the October 18, 2025, independent analysis. During the vehicle's multiple visits for other issues, the dealerships failed to perform this known, required service action, leaving a documented defect unaddressed.

Defect 3: Battery Drain Caused by Head Unit

In SSM 74570, Jaguar identified an issue where the infotainment head unit "wakes up the CAN bus intermittently," causing a "‘Low battery message’ on the instrument panel." This perfectly matches the customer complaint during the service visit spanning from September 30 to October 14, 2024. Rather than investigate this known potential root cause for the low battery warning, the dealership simply replaced the battery. This demonstrates a clear pattern of replacing symptomatic parts rather than diagnosing underlying problems documented by the manufacturer.

The evidence proves the dealerships were not just incompetent; they were negligent in their failure to consult and apply readily available, mandatory directives from Jaguar concerning the proper service of this vehicle.

6.0 Conclusion: A Documented Pattern of Service Negligence and Refusal

The evidence presented in this report, when viewed in its totality, establishes a clear and indefensible pattern of service negligence by authorized Jaguar dealerships. Over several years and multiple service visits, the owner of this 2020 Jaguar F-Type was subjected to a consistent failure to resolve persistent electrical and cooling system issues.

This was not a single mistake but a multi-faceted and repeated failure characterized by:

* Failure to diagnose root causes, such as the critical Gateway Module fault that continues to plague the vehicle's electronic systems.
* Performing ineffective and costly repairs, best exemplified by charging the customer nearly $300 to replace a coolant bleed pipe when the actual, manufacturer-documented failure was the variable coolant pump.
* Failure to execute mandatory service actions for known defects, including the campaigns for the faulty VCT solenoids (H299) and coolant pump operation (H291), leaving the vehicle in a state of disrepair.

Furthermore, the dealership's actions on November 14, 2024—documented as "No diag completed"—constitute clear evidence of an intentional refusal to provide service for a warranted complaint. This refusal directly led to the customer paying out-of-pocket for an incorrect repair days later. The documented evidence overwhelmingly supports a finding of gross negligence on the part of the authorized Jaguar dealerships in their service of vehicle SAJDD1GX4LCK67497.

This was not a case of a difficult diagnosis; it was a documented case of refusing to perform one.
